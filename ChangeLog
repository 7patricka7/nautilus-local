	Fix bug 7830 (Nautilus should launch programs with code that has
	xalf support [like the panel does]).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c:
	(get_xalf_prefix): Implemented, but not tested with xalf.

2001-04-23  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c (set_up_configure_widgets):
	don't set the shadow type of the viewport to no shadow. This
	causes a drawing bug to occur, where vestiges of the checkbox
	prelight aren't erased

2001-04-23  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Prep for xalf feature. Add name of program to all code that
	uses the launch_application_from_command function.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-chooser.c:
	(launch_mime_capplet): Pass the file name of the files and
	programs capplet when starting it up. (Is there a better name to
	use for this case?)
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(change_background_callback): Pass "Background" as the name when
	starting the Background capplet.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: (run_script_callback):
	Pass the file name of the script as the name when starting a
	script.
	(activate_callback): Pass the file name of an executable file when
	starting an executable file by opening it.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c:
	(nautilus_launch_application): Pass the application name from the
	gnome-vfs MIME database when starting an application.
	(get_xalf_prefix): Placeholder for code to figure out the right
	set of parameters to pass to xalf.
	(nautilus_launch_application_from_command): Change to take a name
	for the application. It's ignored when xalf is not used, but used
	as the title when xalf is used.
