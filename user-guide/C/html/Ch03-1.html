<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1034915"></A>Eazel Services are an Internet-based suite of tools designed to simplify system management in Linux. Nautilus and Eazel Services are designed to work together: one complements the other. This chapter presents a description of Eazel Services available in the beta release.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042082"></A>For this beta, Services will include:</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042156"></A>Eazel Software Catalog</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042185"></A>Eazel Software Installer</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bulleted">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042157"></A>Eazel Online Storage</LI>

<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042292"></A>Accessing Services</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042300"></A>There are several ways to access Eazel Services. When starting Nautilus for the first time, the user is asked if they wish to register for Services (Figure 1). </P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1042361"></A>Figure 1: Signing Up for Eazel Services Upon Starting Nautilus</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042377"></A>Upon choosing `yes', the user is immediately taken to the Services registration screen.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042420"></A>On a routine basis, Services can be reached by simply clicking the Services icon on the Nautilus toolbar. Alternatively, they can be reached through any web browser.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042440"></A>Registration</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042459"></A>Registration is not required for all services, but is for some. In this beta release, registration is not required to use the software catalog--users may even download RPMs without registering. However, registration is required to use the Eazel Software Installer (which has added functionality), and for Eazel Online Storage.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042558"></A>Beside the ability to use the Installer, registration also brings the benefit of being able to download the latest version of Nautilus. Other advantages will follow.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042580"></A>Registration is a relatively painless procedure, but the user must complete the process by activating their account with the instructions sent in a validation e-mail. The instructions are sent almost instantaneously.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042265"></A>Eazel Software Catalog</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042152"></A>The Software Catalog is an on-line catalog of Linux software, both Open Source and commercial, that have made it through Eazel's quality assurance process, and are guaranteed to install and work properly on your system.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042636"></A>The software is in RPM format.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042642"></A>The user is able to select software in a variety of ways, from functional categories, from special Eazel recommendations, or from distributions. In addition, there is a search feature, and a sort feature for easier browsing.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042647"></A>Each selected software package has three available views, each providing more detail than the last. The default view will be determined by the user setting--basic, intermediate, or hacker--which the user selected during registration or within Nautilus.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042186"></A>Eazel Software Installer</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042160"></A>The Installer takes into account your distribution, version, and current system, and installs not only the chosen programs, but also automatically installs the necessary dependencies.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042161"></A>This is all accomplished with the help of a client-side inventory program built into Nautilus--making Nautilus an integral part of Eazel Services.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042233"></A>Eazel Online Storage</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042240"></A>This service provides remote backup. Files are backed up and saved on Eazel's servers, but management is exactly the same as if the backup were on the users own local drive.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042731"></A>Initially, Online Storage will offer each user a free 25MB of storage space, to grow as the system matures.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042765"></A>Online Storage is more than just a one-directory file repository. Users can create online folders--even entire directory trees. They can upload and download files, and Nautilus users can copy or move entire folders from their own system to Eazel Online-Line Storage, and back again.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1042770"></A>There is also provision for sharing stored files with other users.</P>
