	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c: Fix size_allocate.

1999-12-14  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (nautilus_navinfo_new): a const char* can't be
	passed where a gchar* is expected.

1999-12-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: Turned on more warnings, including -Werror.
	  I found one or two real bugs, and made some minor changes
	  to quiet the compiler so I could turn on some useful warnings
	  that triggered on the existing code.
	
	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c: (handle_xfer_vfs_error):
	  Fixed a place where it was calling the gnome error(), but using
	  the parameters from the old gnome-fm error() function.

	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view-client.c:
	  (nautilus_meta_view_set_label): Fixed a place where we
	  were passing in string literals to code that will free them.
	  We need to call g_strdup before passing them to gnome_property_bag_add.

	* libnautilus/gnome-icon-container.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-content-view-client.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-view-client.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-content-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-main.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-meta-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-types.h: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-window.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer-progress-dialog.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-cache.c: Fixed a warning.

	* src/*.c: Restructure the whole NautilusWindow code for sanity's sake.
	* src/ntl-uri-map.[ch]: Instead of just passing in various pieces of information about the old URL,
	  pass in the Nautilus_NavigationInfo that has to be kept around anyways.
	* idl/nautilus.idl: Allow a selection to be multiple URI's.

1999-12-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c: (nautilus-window-constructed): Forward-button signal
	was connected with NULL parameter instead of window. Fixed that so it
	has a chance of working.

1999-12-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c: (nautilus-window-constructed): Reordered option menu
	creation code to fix bug where it wasn't sizing itself properly. Changed
	label of placeholder item and desensitized it to make it more obvious that
	it's a non-working placeholder.

1999-12-14  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, icons/: Add icons

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: Everything goes inside the scroll-frame, not the view itself.

1999-12-13  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* libnautils/g*.[ch]: Switch from imlib to pixbuf.
	* src/file-manager: Import from gnome-fm.

	* idl/nautilus.idl: Add a 'main_window' attribute on a ViewFrame, so that views can talk to the main window.

1999-12-10  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view.[ch]: Add a convenience function for
	setting the label.

	* Throughout: Rename the meta view "description" property to "label",
	which more accurately describes its use.

	* components/help: Start turning hyperbola into component.

1999-12-09  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* Start migration from gnome-fm.

src/explorer-location-bar.[ch]:
	Copy over from gnome-fm, change signal to include new URI.
src/ntl-window.c:
	Make NautilusWindow use it.
