To build Nautilus without interfering with an existing Gnome install,
you will need to build several components from CVS into a separate
prefix.

For example, you could install these components into /usr/local/gnome2
or /usr/local/nautilus. Do do this, make sure to specify these with
the --prefix option to autogen.sh or configure.

Specifically, you will need to:

* Install all the needed modules into your selected prefix.

Nautilus currently requires the following modules (built in the given order):

glib:		   glib-1-2
gtk+:		   gtk-1-2
gnome-xml:	   LIB_XML_1_X
ORBit:		   orbit-stable-0-5
oaf:               HEAD
gconf:             HEAD
gnome-libs:	   gnome-libs-1-0
gdk-pixbuf:	   HEAD (with --enable-canvas-pixbuf)
gnome-print:	   HEAD
bonobo:		   HEAD (with --enable-oaf=yes)
gnome-vfs:	   HEAD (with --enable-oaf=yes)
libglade:	   HEAD
gtkhtml:	   HEAD (with --without-bonobo)
eog:               HEAD
gnet:              HEAD

ORBit requires you to install popt-1.5, which can be fetched from:

	ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/popt-1.5-0.45.i386.rpm

* Build and install nautilus into your selected prefix.
