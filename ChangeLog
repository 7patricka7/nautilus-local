	* components/notes/nautilus-notes.c: (make_notes_view):
	* src/nautilus-location-bar.c: (nautilus_location_bar_new):
	* src/nautilus-simple-search-bar.c:
	(nautilus_simple_search_bar_new):
	Use calls by new names.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-signal-handlers.c:
	(editable_key_press_event), (nautilus_undo_editable_set_undo_key):
	Disabled the undo-key part of undo also. The old code was actually
	harmless because it got the name of the signal wrong, but it's
	better to have it disabled.
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml: Added a comment that points out the
	2nd place where undo has been disabled.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-clipboard.h:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-clipboard.c: (cut_callback),
	(copy_callback), (paste_callback), (clear_callback),
	(set_paste_sensitive_if_clipboard_contains_data),
	(focus_changed_callback), (target_destroy_callback),
	(nautilus_clipboard_set_up_editable), (first_focus_callback),
	(control_destroyed_callback),
	(nautilus_clipboard_set_up_editable_in_control),
	(disconnect_set_up_in_control_handlers):
	Some minor cleanup of the clipboard code. Includes bug fixes for
	items that are already in focus when the clipboard is hooked up
	(should never happen), and a fix for code that was using
	gtk_signal_disconnect on something that was connected with
	gtk_signal_connect_while_alive (doesn't work). Also got rid of
	misguided code that was copying a Bonobo_UIContainer with memcpy
	(since Bonobo_UIContainer is just a pointer).
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:
	Changed source file name from nautilus-service-menu to
	nautilus-service-ui, since it does a toolbar item, not just a
	menu.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.c:
	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.h:
	A second cut at the service UI code. It no longer leaks a UI
	component.

	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_get_ui_container): Use our own pointer to the UI
	container instead of asking the shell UI for its container.

2000-10-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3862 (Icon view reversed after looking at list view)
	Fixed bug 916 (workaround for Bonobo radio item bug)
	Also fixed bug where the "tighter layout" and "reversed order"
	items in the context menu were doing nothing at all.

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	Removed "updating_toggle_menu_item" from Details struct.
	(set_tighter_layout): New helper function, handles the code
	common to the Bonobo and GTK menu callbacks.
	(gtk_tighter_layout_callback), (gtk_sort_reversed_callback),
	New functions used for GTK context menu. Will go away when 
	we use Bonobo for context menus.
	(tighter_layout_state_changed_callback),
	(sort_reversed_state_changed_callback): Use passed state value,
	including checking for empty state (empty state happens when
	component is removed from container). This lets us eliminate the
	checks for "updating_toggle_item".	
	(handle_radio_item): Removed check for updating_toggle_menu_item.
	This already worked correctly without this check.
	(insert_one_context_menu_item),	(append_one_context_menu_item),
	(append_one_toggle_context_menu_item): Tweaked these to pass in
	an initial toggle state for toggle menu items, to avoid setting
	the toggle state after the callback has been attached. All this
	code will be removed when we switch to Bonobo for context menus.
	(fm_icon_view_create_selection_context_menu_items),
	(fm_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items),
	(update_layout_menus):

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-item.c:
	(preferences_item_create_font_family):
	Remove the fixed font from the list of available fonts.  Its a bad
	one to use because it crashes the SideBar sometimes.  The problem
	is that the fixed font doesnt support the "find the largest
	fitting font" game that the SideBar plays for long strings.

	Its kinda lame to fix the bug by yanking the font, but we have
	many font improvements planned for after PR2 which will render
	this issue irrelevant.

	Fixes bug 2256.

	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: (rsvg_ft_measure_or_render_string),
	(rsvg_ft_render_string), (rsvg_ft_measure_string):
	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.h:
	Add new function to only measure a string without doing all the
	rendering work.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-scalable-font.c:
	(nautilus_scalable_font_measure_text):
	Use the new rsvg_ft string measuring api.

	Fixes bug 2544.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-font-factory.c:
	(font_hash_node_lookup_with_insertion),
	(nautilus_font_factory_get_fallback_font):
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gdk-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_get_largest_fitting_font), (nautilus_gdk_font_get_bold):
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_gtk_widget_set_font_by_name):
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c: (embed_text):
	* src/nautilus-zoom-control.c: (draw_number):
	Use gdk_fontset_load() instead of gdk_font_load() to make i18n
	work better.  Also marked some hard-coded fonts fot localization.
	There is still an open bug on writing useful comments about these
	for the localizers.  Fixes bugs 3143 and 3144.

	Thanks to Yukihiro Nakai <ynakai@redhat.com> for pointing these
	problems out and providing patches to fix them.
	
	* src/nautilus-profiler.c: (window_print_button_callback),
	(window_save_button_callback), (dump_dialog_new),
	(dump_dialog_show):
	Same as above plus mark some strings for localization and add
	assertions to currently unimplemented functions.
