<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1047930"></A>Nautilus can be launched from three locations: from the GNOME main menu, where the Nautilus menu item can be found under Applications; from the GNOME desktop itself; or from the Panel.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1048215"></A>If you wish to put the Nautilus icon (Figure 1), on your desktop, select the Nautilus menu item and, holding down the left mouse button, drag it to the desktop.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1048216"></A>Probably the easiest way to launch Nautilus is from the GNOME panel (Figure 2). To place the icon there, drag the menu item, as above, to an empty space on the panel at the bottom of the screen. This method has the advantage of speed: the panel is nearly always present, and is at most only a click away. The icon itself needs only one click to launch Nautilus.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1050938"></A>The major elements of the Nautilus file manager include, in the upper part, the menu bar, tool bar and location bar, and below, the sidebar and the main window (Figure 3).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1087024"></A>The menu bar is used to access the pull-down menus, which are the most complete source of Nautilus tools and features. The tool bar provides quick access to Nautilus' most common navigation and search tools, and Eazel Services. The location bar displays system directory location, LAN location, and Internet location--depending on where Nautilus is looking at the given moment.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1050723"></A>The main window is the main viewing area for the system's directories and files, as well as the area where directories and files are generally manipulated. It is capable of showing files in several formats, and includes file information such as size, type, and date last modified.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1087249"></A>The sidebar provides a tree view of directories and sub-directories, as well as a history view (recently viewed files and directories), and a variety of Linux help documents.</P>

<H2 CLASS="Heading1">
<A NAME="pgfId-1041874"></A><A NAME="navigating"></A>Navigating and Viewing The System</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1041877"></A>Nautilus offers several methods to navigate the system. Typing a directory address into the location bar will point Nautilus toward that location. The directional arrows on the tool bar provide a simpler method to navigate back, forward, and up through the system: they function exactly as in a browser. Clicking on a directory icon in the main window will open that directory. Finally, clicking the collapsible branches of the sidebar's tree-view allows the user to graphically view and navigate the directory tree.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1088231"></A>The file manager minimizes the necessity of opening applications by identifying many file types graphically. Viewer components allow several common document types to be displayed without launching a separate application, and a zoom feature provides one-click zooming in and out in the main window. Sound files in certain common formats can even be previewed by simply passing the mouse over the file icon.</P>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1048496"></A>The Initial Screen and Hardware Overview</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1048562"></A>The first screen to appear (Figure 4), shows the contents of your home directory. In this example, the user has logged in under their own name--John--so the home directory is /home/john. Linux follows the UNIX convention for home directories: if the user had logged in as Susan, the home directory would be /home/susan; when logged in as the root user, the home directory is /root.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1088245"></A>The file manager identifies this directory in two ways: as a traditional command line directory address in the location bar, and as a captioned folder icon in the sidebar.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049178"></A>Among the contents of the screen are a Nautilus folder. This folder, when clicked, takes the user to /home/john/Nautilus, Figure 5. Among the contents of the folder are: a small HTML file containing information about Nautilus; a services icon which, when double-clicked, takes you directly to Eazel Services (covered in Chapter Three), and a computer icon which leads to a Hardware Overview of your system, Figure 6.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1049207"></A>Using the Navigation, Refresh and Home Buttons</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049347"></A>The navigation buttons on the left side of the tool bar--Back, Forward, Up, Refresh and Home--are used in a similar way to the navigation buttons on a web browser (Figure 7).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">

<P CLASS="ArtCaption">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049413"></A>Figure 7: Navigation Arrows on the Tool Bar</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1088341"></A>The three left-most buttons allow navigation through the file system by both time and direction.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1088339"></A>The back and forward buttons allow the user to revisit directories and files which the user as already accessed during the current session. This is navigation through time. The previous example illustrates this: clicking on the back button from the hardware overview screen will take the user back to the /home/john screen, but once there, the back button will be dimmed out: there is no further `back' in time to go so far in this session.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049498"></A>Similarly, clicking the forward button at this point would take the user once again to the /home/john/Nautilus screen.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049507"></A>The up button navigates upward through the directory hierarchy. This is navigation by direction. As an example, in the previous section it is impossible--solely with the back button--to go up through the file system further than /home/john. However, by clicking the up button, the user can navigate first to /home, and then all the way to /.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1055965"></A>Clicking the refresh button refreshes the view of the current directory.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1056041"></A>The home button will always take the user to the current session's home directory. If the user has logged on as root, then the home button, when clicked, will open /root. If the user has logged on as Laura, the directory opened will be /home/laura. Note: this is, as are so many features in Nautilus, customizable--see Chapter Two.</P>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049549"></A>Viewing as Icons, or as a List</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1049557"></A>Although directories and files are by default viewed, in the main window, as icons, there is some advantage to viewing them as a list. At a normal magnification level, more information will be displayed in list view, such as the file's type and modification date. To change the view style, click on the View as Icons button, to the bottom-right of the tool bar (Figure 8), and choose `List'.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1056304"></A>The list view still includes representative icons, but the extra space used by the extra description means the icons must be minimized. The Date Modified column is particularly clear, with descriptive terms used where the latest modification of the file or directory is within the last week (Figure 9).</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1049568"></A>Using Tree View in the Sidebar</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1034940"></A>`Tree view' refers to a collapsible list of directories, sub-directories and files. In Nautilus, it is available in the sidebar. The advantage of tree view is that it allows the user to clearly observe the directory structure at a glance, thus simplifying directory and file administration.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1057612"></A>To activate tree view, click the Tree tab at the bottom of the sidebar screen. At first, the tree may be collapsed, showing a single folder (Figure 10).</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1057707"></A>To expand the directory structure, click once on the right arrow pointing toward the folder. The arrow will immediately point down, and the root directories appear in the sidebar. Clicking any sub-directory arrow will expand that sub-directory, but not automatically expand the view in the main window. Notice in Figure 11 that although the tree in the sidebar is expanded to /T/ARCHIVE/Redhat/ETC, the main window and the location bar are still showing the folders within /home/john.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1073850"></A>(Also notice that, when necessary, vertical and horizontal scroll bars appear automatically on the sidebar panels).</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1057750"></A>To synchronize the displays--that is, to display the contents of the same directory in both the sidebar and the main window--simply click on the desired folder icon in the sidebar's tree view (Figure 12). In this illustration, the user has clicked on the icon representing the directory </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1073863"></A>/demo in the sidebar. Both the location bar and the main window now reflect this location, with the main window displaying the contents of the demo directory in icon view.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1057847"></A>Exploring the directory tree within the sidebar alone is usually faster than exploring it within the main window. To expand directories without updating the main window, click on the small right arrows in tree view. In the example shown in Figure 13, the /etc directory has been expanded, as has the /X11 subdirectory. Beneath that are several more subdirectories, and the XF86Config file, which configures the X server.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1089631"></A>There may be times when the directory tree is so expanded, the user may lose sight of the upper branches. In such a situation, the user can either scroll with the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the sidebar, or, by holding down the left mouse button, enlarge the sidebar by dragging its right-hand edge into the main window area.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1074352"></A>The result--shown in Figure 16, after two clicks on the + sign, bringing magnification up to 150%--is a far more easily read display, with the various graphics card types clearly identifiable. The Chips &amp; Technology README file is on the left. This example also shows how greater magnification leads to more file and directory information displayed.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1058438"></A>There may be times, especially on computers with large displays, when, instead of using the vertical scroll bar to find a file or directory, it may be faster to `zoom out', and view a larger area. To do this, click on the minus sign to the left of the plus sign.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1058372"></A>Viewing and Opening Files Within Nautilus</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059046"></A>Certain common file types can be identified, read, or, in the case of music files, heard, from within Nautilus, without having to open the file's application.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059071"></A>Graphics files of many common types are represented as `thumbnails'--realistic iconic representations of their content. To inspect them more closely, without opening their related application, the user can enlarge them using the zoom feature.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059070"></A>Other types of files use different viewing methods. Many text files can be read just by clicking on them once in the main window. This is both faster than opening up a separate console, or application, and it also uses fewer system resources. Figure 17 shows an example using the README.chips file.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1090711"></A>Nautilus' unique design includes elements of a web browser as well as a traditional file manager. As a result, Nautilus can browse the Web, and also graphically browse the machines of a typical mixed corporate LAN running a combination of Windows, Linux and UNIX machines.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1058926"></A>Manipulating directories and files is one of the most basic of all file manager features. Nautilus can be used to graphically move, copy, duplicate, rename and delete files, and to create new and rename existing directories. It can also be used as a search engine, on the local machine, the LAN, and the Web. Finally, in Nautilus the user can graphically change a file's permissions--a great advance over the command line CHMOD method.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1059870"></A>Moving and Copying Files</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059880"></A>These two file management activities are performed by opening two Nautilus windows, one for the source location and one for the destination.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059883"></A>Open a new Nautilus window by clicking on File on the menu bar, and choosing the first menu item: New Window (Figure 26).</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1059917"></A>To move a file, simply drag it from the source window to the destination window, with the left mouse button depressed. For options, drag the file with the right mouse button: this gives the choices of either moving or copying the file, or of creating a link.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059920"></A>An example of a successful file copy operation is shown in Figure 27. The pluck.wav file has been copied from the /home/john directory (the source), in the lower-right Nautilus window, to the /home/john/music directory, in the upper-left Nautilus window.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059935"></A>Duplicating a file is accomplished by either clicking on the file with the right mouse button, and selecting Duplicate, or by first selecting the file and then selecting Duplicate from the File pull-down menu on the menu bar (Figure 28). Notice in the illustration that the duplicate file is identified by the tag (copy) next to the file name.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059960"></A>Renaming a file is accomplished in a similar manner. Choose the same menu by either means, and click on Rename. Then simply type the new name into the file caption.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059961"></A>Deleting a file, in Nautilus, means moving it to the trash folder which Nautilus creates upon installation. A file may be deleted either by dragging and dropping it into the trash folder, or by selecting the file, opening the same menu as above, and choosing Move to Trash.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1059962"></A>Note that moving a file to the trash folder does not delete it from the system. It is still available, and can still be retrieved, in case the user has trashed it mistakenly. Permanent file deletion is accomplished by clicking the Empty Trash item in the File menu</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1086889"></A>A new subdirectory can be created (and/or renamed), anywhere in the directory tree, by selecting the parent directory and then pulling down the File menu from the menu bar. Click on New Folder, and the new subdirectory is created. Just type in the name and hit the Enter key.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1092318"></A>To search for a file either locally or on a Samba LAN, click the Find button on the tool bar, and type in the name of the desired file. Then click the Find Them button.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1092323"></A>This is the simplest form of file search, but by clicking the More Options button--several times--no fewer than seven search variables become available. Each variable in turn has its own set of constraints. In this way it is possible to narrow down, or refine a search very precisely (Figure 29).</P>
