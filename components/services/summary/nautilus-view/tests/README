To use these tests do the following:
su - root
cp *.xml /home/httpd/html or wherever the root of your webserver lives.
set #define DEBUG_TEST 1
rebuild the summary view and install.
It will probably fail right now if you don't have access to services.eazel.com
since several of the remote images live there.
