        <title>Nautilus and Eazel Services</title>


	<para>
	Eazel Services are an Internet-based suite of tools 
	designed to simplify system management in 
	Linux. Nautilus and Eazel Services work together: 
	one complements the other. This chapter presents 
	a description of Eazel Services available for 
	the preview release two.
	</para>

	<para>
	For this release, Services will include:

	<title>Accessing Services</title>

	<para>
	There are several ways to access Eazel Services. 
	When starting Nautilus for the first time, the user 
	is asked if they wish to learn about, sign up, or 
	log on to Services (Figure 1). 
	</para>

	</figure>


	<para>
	On a routine basis, Services can be reached by 
	simply clicking the Services icon on the Nautilus 
	toolbar. Alternatively, they can be reached 
	through any web browser, from www.eazel.com.
	</para>

	<title>Registration and Login</title>

	<para>
	Registration--for this preview release--is not required for the 
	software catalog, but is for online storage.
	</para

	<para>
	Registration is the same from Nautilus or from any browser.  The 
	screen is divided into three sections: the required fields to open 
	an account (Figure 2); the optional personal profile section, and 
	the optional computing environment section.
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Required Account Information in Registration</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch3-account-info" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	The user completes the process by activating their account with the
	instructions sent in a validation e-mail.  The instructions are sent
	almost instantaneously.
	</para>

	<para>
	Logging in can be accomplished either from the greeting page which 
	follows account validation, from clicking services in Nautilus, or 
	from the Eazel website, www.eazel.com.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Welcome screen, Figure 3, is organized into three basic sections.  
	The top section has links for reaching the Eazel support page, for 
	changing user preferences, and for logging out.
	</para>

	<para>
	The support page has a number of FAQs and other help features.  The 
	preferences link allows the user to change or update personal and 
	computer preferences, and even passwords.

	<para>
	The second section down is devoted to Online Storage, and has links to 
	the users private and public storage folder.
	</para>

	<para>
	The third section allows the user to either browse or search the Eazel 
	software catalog.
	</para>



	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="ch3-catalog">
	<title>Eazel Software Catalog</title>

	<para>
	The Software Catalog is an on-line catalog of 
	Linux software, both Open Source and commercial, that should
	install and work properly--in this preview release--on a Redhat 6.0 
	to 6.2 system.
	</para>

	<para>
	The software is in RPM format.
	</para>

	<para>
	The user is able to select software by either browsing the online 
	catalog by category, or by searching for a specific package with a 
	keyword.  Both catalog browsing and searching can be further refined 
	by specifying a Redhat distribution version.
	</para>

	<para>
	When browsing, the user is presented with thirteen different categories,	from Communications to Text Editors.  Selecting the first, for example, 	opens a separate screen dedicated to communications software (Figure 4), 	with a list of package titles and short summaries.
	</para>
	
	<figure>
	<title>Package Titles and Summaries</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch3-package-titles" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	Selecting the package title takes the user to a further screen, giving 
	more complete information, including the version and release number, 
	the source and vendor, a more complete description, package size, etc.
	</para>

	<para>
	Pressing the download button sets up a download of the selected package
	--in RPM format--to the users home directory.
	</para>

	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="ch3-installer">
	<title>Eazel Software Installer</title>

	<para>
	The Software Installer, which functions when accessing Services through 	Nautilus, takes into account your distribution, 
	version, and current system, and installs not only 
	the chosen programs, but also automatically 
	installs the necessary dependencies.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	This is all accomplished with the help of a client-
	side inventory program built into Nautilus--
	making Nautilus an integral part of Eazel 
	Services.
	</para>
	
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="ch3-vault">
	<title>Eazel Online Storage</title>

	<para>
	Each user is provided initially with 25MB of free storage space, in two 	folders, private and public.
	</para>

	<para>
	Online Storage is more than just a one-directory 
	file repository. Users can create online folders--
	even entire directory trees. They can upload and 
	download files, and Nautilus users can copy or 
	move entire folders from their own system to 
	Eazel Online Storage, and back again.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Clicking on either the Private or Public folder icon takes the user to 		the Online Storage screen (Figure 5).
	</para>
	
	<figure>
	<title>The Online Storage Screen</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch3-online-storage" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	From here, the user can see immediately which files they have in 
	storage, and how much space they have left available.  They may also 
	choose to create a sub-folder, to upload or download files, or to 
	copy, move, or delete selected items.
	</para>
