Global


-------------------------------------------
You will immediately notice that I've removed most of these tags:

<guimenu>
<guimenuitem>

I've done this because it is generally thought to be a poor practice
to bold lots of items, and especially to bold every single mention of
an item from the interface. I'll be explaining why this is so when I
have a chance to participate in the GNOME documentation project's
mailing list! Until then, I hope people will bear with me.

It's not necessary to accept this change if you don't want to change
your localized versions. You should check, however, for errors in
applying the tags -- there were many in my previous version!


-------------------------------------------
Change everything that looks like this:

<note>
<title>Try this</title>
<para>To keep Nautilus easily available, add its icon to the GNOME Panel:</para>
</note>

To this:

<tip>
<title>Try this</title>
<para>To keep Nautilus easily available, add its icon to the GNOME Panel:</para>
</tip>

(Change all items tagged as "notes" to "tips")


-------------------------------------------
Spell out names of keyboard keys.

There's only one instance of this in the user manual -- replace "Esc" with "Escape"


-------------------------------------------
These items are TWO WORDS instead of one (this may affect only English):

file name
path name
user name


-------------------------------------------
This item is ONE WORD instead of two:

toolbar


-------------------------------------------
These items are all lower case (no initial capital letters):

location bar
sidebar
find bar
preferences menu
tree
home (as in home folder, home location)
play, pause, stop (as in the music player's buttons)

(exceptions: figure captions, callouts, section headings. "Tree" is
capitalized when referring to "the Tree tab.")


-------------------------------------------
The word "Web" is always capitalized (according to the Eazel style guide)

Web pages
Web site
Web address
etc.


-------------------------------------------
The words "plus" and "minus" should be replaced by the symbols + and -


-------------------------------------------
These words should be capitalized, when referring to user levels:

Beginner
Intermediate
Advanced


This word should be hyphenated (formerly was two words):

user-level

SPECIFIC CHANGES


-------------------------------------------
OLD:
   Nautilus is a core component of the GNOME desktop
   environment. Nautilus provides an easy way to view, manage, and
   customize your own files and folders, as well as browse the Web.

NEW:

-------------------------------------------
In Chapter 1 under "Toolbar," please fix this mispelling:

OLD: Easel
NEW: Eazel

(oops...)


------------------------------------------- 
Big change to the first section (The Nautilus Window): The figure has
been changed to remove the callouts and replace them with
numbers. This is to aid in localization. It's not necessary to make
this change now if you've already localized this illustration; in the
future I will assist.

Small inline pictures have been added to each paragraph, referring
back to the figure. If you don't re-do the illustration using my "new"
approach, then don't include these numbers.


-------------------------------------------
OLD:
The eight menus contain options for most file and folder
management tasks, and let you personalize your view of all the
applications, folders, and files on your hard disk. The Preferences
menu, represented by the symbol to the right of the Help menu, lets

in any view. Click the magnifying glass to return to normal size. (If
you've changed your theme, the magnifying glass may be replaced by a
different symbol.)

OLD:
The desktop is the background area of your screen. By default,
on your GNOME system, Nautilus draws the desktop. The desktop on your
computer can look like your physical desktop - it can be full of
folders, icons, and works in progress, or it can be cleared
off. Nautilus lets you organize it the way you want.

NEW: The desktop is the background area of your screen. If
Nautilus was pre-installed on your GNOME system, Nautilus draws the

want.

(change "By default, on your GNOME system," to "If Nautilus was
pre-installed on your GNOME system")

Another big change: This section's illustration has been changed so
that callouts are now numbers. Again, if you have already localized
this picture it's not necessary to change. If you need help, let me
know.


-------------------------------------------
OLD:

-------------------------------------------
OLD:
Fast searches: If your user level is set to intermediate
and if you have Medusa turned on, Nautilus searches the files on your
hard disk by file name, creator, file type, and other attributes, as
well as by the actual content of files.

NEW: Complex searches: If your user level is set to
intermediate or advanced, Nautilus searches the files on your hard
disk by file name, creator, file type, and other attributes, as well
as by the actual content of files.

(change "Fast" to "Complex"; add "or advanced"; remove "and if you
have Medusa turned on")


-------------------------------------------
OLD:
<para><guimenu>Medusa</guimenu></para>

NEW:
<para><guimenu>Fast Versus Slow Searches</guimenu></para>


-------------------------------------------
Remove this paragraph:

Medusa is an indexing daemon - a small utility that runs in the
background when your computer is idle. Medusa indexes all the content
in the files on your computer and on mounted volumes (such as CD-ROM
disks), so you can quickly find any string of text in any of your
files.


------------------------------------------- 
Move this material from the section titled "Complex Searches"
(formerly "Fast Searches) to the section titled "Fast Versus Slow
Searches" (formerly "Medusa") NOTE: This material also contains some
changes and additions. These are detailed at the end of this section
of "Tracked Changes."

Nautilus uses Medusa, a daemon, which is a piece of software
that runs in the background. Medusa creates an index of all the items
on your hard disk and mounted volumes, including their names, size,
creation date, and other attributes. In addition, Medusa indexes the
actual <emphasis>content</emphasis> of each file - so you can find any
word or phrase in any file on your computer when you search by
content.

Medusa runs when your computer is idle, so it doesn't disrupt
your activities.

If Medusa has not finished indexing your system or is not
running on your computer, then when you do a search you may see a
message letting you know that Nautilus can't perform a fast
search.

If you suspect that Medusa is not turned on, do this:

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Open a terminal window.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Log into your system as root.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Enter this command at the command line:
medusa-searchd</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>If Medusa is still not turned on, do this:</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Open the preferences menu and choose
Preferences.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>From the left column of the Preferences dialog box,
choose Search</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>In the Fast Search section, turn on "Enable fast
search."</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>


Other changes (all shown above): 

First paragraph, remove "when your computer is idle". 

Add new second paragraph: "<para>Medusa runs when your computer is
idle, so it doesn't disrupt your activities.</para>")

Add new section of steps at the end, explaining how to turn on Medusa
in Preferences dialog.

-------------------------------------------
Add this paragraph at the beginning of the section, "What Are MIME Types?":

<para>
MIME types are a standard way to identify files so that they can
be easily transmitted over the Internet. MIME stands for "Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extention." Each type of file is assigned a specific
MIME type. For instance, the MIME type for HTML files is "text/html,"
and the MIME type for JPEG files is "image/jpeg." A file's MIME type
tells Internet applications such as browsers and email programs what
type of file is being exchanged, how to encode it for transmission,
and how to decode it when it arrives at its destination.
</para>


-------------------------------------------
OLD:
When you open a file, unless you specify a particular application or
viewer for the file it normally opens automatically in an application
that's appropriate for the file type. For instance, a graphics file
normally opens automatically in a graphics application.

NEW:
Unless you've specified that a particular application or viewer should
open a file, it normally opens automatically in an application that's
appropriate for the type. For instance, a JPEG file normally opens
automatically in a graphics application.

(first sentence re-writtern; "file type" changed to "type"; "a graphics file" changed to "a JPEG file")


-------------------------------------------
Remove this paragraph:

<para>
The application that's set to automatically open for a
particular type of file is known as the file handler for that file
type. File handlers are also referred to as MIME types or file
types.
</para>


-------------------------------------------
OLD:
You can choose which application or viewer opens automatically
for a particular file or file types. You can also set up new file
handlers.

NEW: 
You can choose which application or viewer opens
automatically for a particular file or type of file. You can also set
up new applications to handle particular types of files.

There is another (third) copyright boilerplate section at the very end
of the document.

NOT TRACKED:

The editor had me remove commas from several places. Since these
changes are unlikely to affect other languages, I didn't note them in
this document.

Remove the last row from the table that appears beneath this paragraph:

"Here are some of the file types for which the Nautilus window can act
as a viewer:"

The information that needs to be removed pertains to RPM
files. Nautilus 1.0 will not include the RPM viewer.

The information about Medusa has changed.

    of these Nautilus search utilities:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Simple searches: If your user level is set to Beginner, Nautilus
      performs a quick and easy search by file name.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Complex searches: If your user level is set to Intermediate or
      Advanced, Nautilus searches the files on your hard disk by file
      name, creator, file type, and other attributes, as well as by
      the actual content of files.
     </para>
    </listitem>

   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    <guimenu>Fast Versus Slow Searches</guimenu>
   </para>

   <para>
    Nautilus uses Medusa, a daemon, which is a piece of software that
    runs in the background. Medusa creates an index of all the items
    on your hard disk and mounted volumes, including their names,
    size, creation date, and other attributes. In addition, Medusa
    indexes the actual <emphasis>content</emphasis> of each file - so
    you can find any word or phrase in any file on your computer when
    you search by content.
   </para>

   <para>
    Medusa runs when your computer is idle, so it doesn't disrupt your
    activities.
   </para>

   <para>
    If Medusa has not finished indexing your system or is not running
    on your computer, when you do a search you may see a message
    letting you know that Nautilus can't perform a fast search.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you suspect that Medusa is not turned on, do this:
   </para>
