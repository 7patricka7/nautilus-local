This holds assumptions for the file

legalpara must go before copyright

each listitem has one para

each formalpara has one para

CDATA must be in the form
<![CDATA[...
<![CDATA [..., <![ CDATA [..., and <![ CDATA[...
are all invalid xml

you must quote all attributes:
<foo id="foo"> is right
<foo id=foo> is wrong

all tags must be lowercase (this is an DocBook xml requirement, not
mine)
