This is a description of the requirements for the rpmsearch.cgi script. 
Eskil Olsen, updated 20000710.

The rpmsearch.cgi script needs to support the following ;

Main entry points ;

?name=; Package name, case sensitive and excact match, eg. "gconf" must not match "GConf", and
	"GConf" should match "GConf" but not "GConf-devel".
?provides=; Find a package that provides the given file.

For ?name=; the following attributes must be supported, attributes marked with (!) will
always be given ;

&version[=|>=|>]; The package must have version equal, equal or greater or greater then the given version number.

( 
	Optional of interest, in case of provides conflict (eg. more then one rpm provides libbla.a)

	For ?provides=; the following attributes must be supported, attributes marked with (!) will
	always be given ;

	&forpackage=; SoftCat must know, that for "forpackage", if there are more then one
		rpm (A and B) that provides the given file, A is the most appropriate.
)

For ?name; and ?provide=; the following attributes must be supported. Again (!) identifies
always given attributes.

&arch=; (!) The package must be for the given architechture. The arch is given as a string, matching the strings
	given by uname(1). If no package matches the arch, but a package for "noarch" is present, 
	return this. The arch "src" is a special arch.
&distro=""; (!) The package must be for the given distributions. Currently that string will most likely be in the
	format of "RedHat Linux x.y". If needed, the version of the distro can be moved to seperate fields.
&protocol=; (!) Designates the protocol used in the returned URL. Will currently be either "http" or "ftp".


Samples;

return http://blech.blah/path/glib-1.2.8-1.i386.rpm

given rpmsearch.cgi?name=libgtop-devel&version=1.0.7&arch=i386&distro="RedHat Linux 6.2"&protocol=http;
return http://blech.blah/path/libgtop-devel-1.0.7-1.i386.rpm

given rpmsearch.cgi?provides=libgtop.a&arch=i386&distro="RedHat Linux 6.2"&protocol=http;
return http://blech.blah/path/libgtop-devel-1.0.7-1.i386.rpm
