For tasks outside the porting effort, we track them as bugs in
http://bugzilla.gnome.org.

- Make closing a window work (Bonobo fix needed).
- Get list view working.
- Visit all the destroy and move things into finalize or dispose
  and make them callable twice as appropriate.
- Change things that use destroy handlers to use weak references
  instead.
- Figure out why we get NULL font problems in Pango when the progress
  dialog comes up.

- Get EelLabel working and switch back to it on the sidebar.
- Get rid of the direct freetype use and switch to using
  Pango instead.
