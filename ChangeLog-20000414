	has a chance of working.

	* src/ntl-window.c: (nautilus-window-constructed): Reordered option menu
	creation code to fix bug where it wasn't sizing itself properly. Changed
	label of placeholder item and desensitized it to make it more obvious that
	it's a non-working placeholder.

	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view.[ch]: Add a convenience function for
