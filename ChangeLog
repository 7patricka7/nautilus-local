	reviewed by: John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 6163 (Need NautilusViewFrame ::
	report_location_changed). This is re-adding a feature we also had
	long ago, where a view reports a location change, but does not
	want the location change to come back to it in the form of a
	load_location call.

	* src/nautilus-applicable-views.h:
	* src/nautilus-applicable-views.c:
	(get_view_result_from_gnome_vfs_result), (got_file_info_callback),
	(got_minimum_file_info_callback),
	(nautilus_determine_initial_view),
	(nautilus_determine_initial_view_cancel): Changed this entire file
	to have a much easier-to-understand API.
	
	* src/nautilus-view-frame-private.h:
	* src/nautilus-view-frame-corba.c: (free_location_plus_callback):
	Change existing structure so it can be used for the location-change
	case, which includes a title too.
	(open_force_new_window): Use new structure.
	(report_location_change): Implement new call.
	(impl_Nautilus_ViewFrame_open_location_force_new_window): Use new
	structure.
	(impl_Nautilus_ViewFrame_report_location_change): Implement new
	call.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view-component.idl: Add the new call.
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.h:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.c:
	(nautilus_view_report_location_change): Add the new call.

	* src/nautilus-view-frame.h:
	* src/nautilus-view-frame.c:
	(nautilus_view_frame_initialize_class): Add new signal.
	(nautilus_view_frame_report_location_change): Implement new call.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.h:
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: (update_for_new_location):
	Got rid of obsolete assert. Also, no longer clear the selection.
	The selection is set properly earlier, and clearing it at this
	point serves no purpose.
	(location_has_really_changed): Call free_location_change to share
	more code. Also no reason to free "pending_ni" any more, because
	we don't keep it around in the success case.
	(load_new_location_in_one_view): New name.
	(load_new_location_in_sidebar_panels): New name. Also take a
	parameter of a view to skip.
	(load_new_location_in_all_views): New function.
	(set_to_pending_location_and_selection): New name, and removed
	code to handle the case where there is no pending location, since
	that doesn't happen. Also take a parameter of a view to skip. Also
	broke out the guts into load_new_location_in_all_views.
	(free_location_change): Free things by their new names. There's
	also less to free now.
	(cancel_location_change): Key off pending_location instead of
	pending_ni. Also save code by using new function that skips a
	view.
	(determined_initial_view_callback): Changed name, and use new
	interface. No longer need "end_reached" trick, because the new
	interface handles that.
	(begin_location_change): Made a static after moving all the
	functions that use it in here. Also moved some of the reload
	code out into nautilus_window_reload.
	(report_location_change_callback): New function. Does all the
	steps neede for a location change in place.
	(nautilus_window_back_or_forward), (nautilus_window_reload): Moved
	these two functions in here from nautilus-window.c so we could
	make begin_location_change more private.
	
	* src/nautilus-window.h:
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_go_to): Changed the name.
	(nautilus_window_get_location): New function for callers that used
	to get the location field directly.
	(go_to_callback): Changed name.

	* src/nautilus-desktop-window.c: (nautilus_desktop_window_new):
	* src/nautilus-location-bar.c: (drag_data_received_callback):

	(nautilus_window_constructed), (view_as_menu_vfs_method_callback),
	(nautilus_window_go_web_search), (nautilus_window_go_home):
	Use nautilus_go_to under its new name.
	
	* src/nautilus-shell.c: (restore_window_states): Use
	nautilus_istr_has_prefix instead of g_strncasecmp. Also did other
	code cleanup.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.h: Added a new
	marshal function that I needed.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-thumbnails.c: Added a FIXME.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-view-identifier.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-view-identifier.c:
	(nautilus_view_identifier_copy),
	(nautilus_view_identifier_compare): Use const.
	
	* src/nautilus-application.c: (nautilus_application_startup): Only
	check for root if we are actually running nautilus, not if we are
	just killing off an existing copy.
	(confirm_ok_to_run_as_root): Changed name of the function and
	improved the wording of the message and button. Also added an
	environment variable you can set to get rid of this. (Probably
	should have been a preference instead, but I am officially being
	lazy about this.)

	Fixed bug that was revealed by the change in the loading sequence
	I made. John didn't review this part:
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(load_directory_state_destroy), (load_directory_done):
	Separate out code to free the partly-done state so it can
	be used in the cancel case.
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback): Ref the directory object
	so that we won't get messed up if the callback destroys it.
	(directory_load_cancel): Separated out the old part of
	file_list_cancel so that we can cancel the idle part too
	when we want to.
	(file_list_cancel): Use the new calls to cancel the idle
	part of directory loading.
	(directory_load_done): Use directory_load_cancel instead of
	file_list_cancel.
	(nautilus_directory_stop_monitoring_file_list): Use
	directory_load_cancel instead of file_list_cancel.
	(nautilus_directory_async_state_changed): Added state variables to
	protect cases where we re-enter this function.
