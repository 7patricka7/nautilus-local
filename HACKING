To build Nautilus without interfering with an existing Gnome install,
you will need to build several components from CVS into a separate
prefix.

For example, you could install these components into /usr/local/gnome2
or /usr/local/nautilus. Do do this, make sure to specify these with
the --prefix option to autogen.sh or configure.

Specifically, you will need to:


* Install all the needed modules into your selected prefix.

Nautilus currently requires the following modules from GNOME CVS
(built in the given order):

module             branch              configure options
------             ------              -----------------
glib:		   glib-1-2
gtk+:		   gtk-1-2
gnome-xml:	   LIB_XML_1_X
ORBit:		   orbit-stable-0-5
oaf:               HEAD
gconf:             HEAD
gnome-libs:	   gnome-libs-1-0
gdk-pixbuf:	   HEAD               --enable-canvas-pixbuf
gnome-print:	   HEAD
bonobo:		   HEAD               --enable-oaf=yes
gnome-vfs:	   HEAD               --enable-oaf=yes
libglade:	   HEAD
gtkhtml:	   HEAD               --without-bonobo
eog:               HEAD               --enable-oaf=yes
gnet:              HEAD

Other modules for Red Hat users:

- For other modules, the versions in Red Hat 6.1 will do.
- ORBit requires popt-1.5, which can be fetched from:

	ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/popt-1.5-0.45.i386.rpm

Other modules for Debian users (we haven't tried this ourselves):

- You'll need libwww, which can be found at:

	ftp://ftp.internatif.org/pub/debian/UNOFFICIAL/libw3c-libwww5_5.2.8-1_i386.deb
	ftp://ftp.internatif.org/pub/debian/UNOFFICIAL/libw3c-libwww-dev_5.2.8-1_i386.deb



* Build and install nautilus into your selected prefix.

Also, you need to do a "killall oafd; killall gconfd" before
running Nautilus if OAF, GConf, or any of the .oafinfo files
in any module changed.

All patches should go through nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com
