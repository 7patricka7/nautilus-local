	-  Should look at going over to a SAX based interface for processing
	   the XML files.  It would have the advantage of being less memory
	   intensive.  It might also be a bit more robust given the current
	   use of copied pointers.  

	   SAX would require some seperate data structures though, as the 
	   positioning within the tree is important.  The current DOM approach
	   is more natural because we're populating a tree from a tree.  SAX
           may not be suited to this task.

	-  See about specifying levels of TOC to process in Nautilus preferences
	   and reading this in the component.
