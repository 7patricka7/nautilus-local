To build Nautilus without interfering with an existing Gnome install,
you will need to build several components from CVS into a separate
prefix.

For example, you could install these components into /usr/local/gnome2
or /usr/local/nautilus. Do do this, make sure to specify these with
the --prefix option to autogen.sh or configure.

Specifically, you will need to:

* Get the gnome.m4 file from gnome-libs HEAD, and and manually copy it
to your $(prefix)/share/aclocal/gnome directory. 

* Install gnome-xml, ORBit, gnome-print, gtkhtml, gnome-vfs and bonobo
from CVS, in that order. Make sure to autogen with your selected
prefix.

* Build and install nautilus into your selected prefix.


All patches should go through nautilus-maint@gnome.org
