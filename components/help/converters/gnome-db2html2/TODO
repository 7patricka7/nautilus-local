List of things I know I need to do:
-----------------------------------

Store the id of the sect with the title of the graphic so that I can get
xref correctly.

Store sect level so we can do <H2>/<H3> correctly for section headers - This
appears to be done (if this is meant for the table of contents) 

Implement variablelist

Fix broken entities.

Tables are now done - They just need extensive testing and possible some
tweaking
