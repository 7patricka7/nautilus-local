	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:
	(nautilus_rpm_view_initialize), (check_installed),
	(nautilus_rpm_view_update_from_uri):
	removed anti-aliased text from rpm_view, since it was causing
	too many problems; displayed icon contained in package header, or
	a generic package icon if there isn't one; gather and display
	package install time correctly.
