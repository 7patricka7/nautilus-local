Infrastructure
--------------
. Scheme translation and handling
. File manager
  - Virtual directories/files/actions
. Actions/file operations in general
. Figure out how to provide clean and separate abstractions for data
  transfer and presentation (views handle both right now).
. Sometimes a navigation request needs extra data besides a URI to be
  a complete specification of a document. For instance, an http URI also
  requires a method (GET or POST) to be specified, and in the case of
  POST an arbitrary number of additional key-value pairs. Figure out a
  way to support this right.


Components
----------
. Image viewer (EOG?)
. Text, postscript, PDF
. File manager

standard convention.
