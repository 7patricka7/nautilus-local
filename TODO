For tasks outside the porting effort, we track them as bugs in
http://bugzilla.gnome.org. For the porting effort, please let
darin@bentspoon.com know what you are working on.

- Make closing a window work without crashing (Bonobo fixes needed?).

- Port list view to GtkTreeView and then go to eel and remove
  EelCList, EelList, and EelListColumnTitle.
- Port tree sidebar panel to GtkTreeView and then go to eel and
  remove EelCTree.

- Visit all the GNOME2_CONVERSION_COMPLETE and fix each issue
  (details forthcoming)

- Visit all the destroy and move things into finalize or dispose
  and make them callable twice as appropriate.
- Change things that use destroy handlers to use weak references
  instead.

- Figure out why we get NULL font problems in Pango when the progress
  dialog comes up.

- Split out icons and themes into a separate package?
