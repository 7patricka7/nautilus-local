To build Nautilus without interfering with an existing Gnome install,
you will need to build several components from CVS into a separate
prefix.

For example, you could install these components into /usr/local/gnome2
or /usr/local/nautilus. Do do this, make sure to specify these with
the --prefix option to autogen.sh or configure.

Specifically, you will need to:

* Get the gnome.m4 file from gnome-libs HEAD, and and manually copy it
to your $(prefix)/share/aclocal/gnome directory. 

* Install gnome-xml, ORBit, gnome-print, gtkhtml, gnome-vfs and bonobo
from CVS, in that order. Make sure to autogen with your selected
prefix.

* Build and install nautilus into your selected prefix.

Nautilus currently requires the following modules (built in the given order):

glib:		   glib-1-2
gtk+:		   gtk-1-2
gnome-libs:	   gnome-libs-1-0

libglade:	   HEAD
gnome-xml:	   HEAD
ORBit:		   HEAD
gnome-vfs:	   HEAD
bonobo:		   HEAD
gdk-pixbuf:	   HEAD
gnome-print:	   HEAD
gtkhtml:	   HEAD

ORBit requires you to install popt-1.5, which can be fetched from:

ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/popt-1.5-0.36.i386.rpm

All patches should go through nautilus-maint@gnome.org
