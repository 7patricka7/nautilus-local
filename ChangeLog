	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:

	Did not build on redhat 5.2 because RPMTAG_FILENAMES has been
	obseleted in the version of rpm that ships with 5.2 apparently.
	I added a dumb hack to define RPMTAG_FILENAMES to
	RPMTAG_OLDFILENAMES which is almost surely the wrong thing to do,
	but i really need to have nautilus building while i do the
	nautilus view changes.  I gave myself a bug to properly address
	this soon (472).
