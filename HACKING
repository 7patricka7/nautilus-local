Nautilus source tree is available from cvs for the latest-cutting
edge version and from tarballs whenever we really get tired of people 
asking us for releases. 

If you plan to hack on nautilus, please make sure you work from the cvs 
version. cvs version is available by anonymous cvs from GNOME cvs server.
http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html details how to get started 
with cvs.

If you want to contribute back patches, please, make sure you mail the 
nautilus maintainer (namely, Dain Adler: <darin@eazel.com>) and 
nautilus mailing list: <nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com> (subscribtions
should be made to <nautilus-list-request@lists.eazel.com> with "subscribe"
as a subject)

Patches should be made with 'cvs diff -u >patch' and should conform to 
the nautilus coding style as detailed in docs/style-guide.html
Please, make sure to read the relevant documents in the docs directory 
too.

2: Using the leak checker
===============================

Nautilus is set up to use the libleakcheck.so leak checking libary. To
use it run nautilus with LD_PRELOAD set to the path to the installed
libleakcheck.so libary. For example, if you are using a
bourne-compatible shell, like bash, you can run nautilus this way to
run with leak checking:

LD_PRELOAD=/gnome/libs/libleakcheck.so /gnome/bin/nautilus
