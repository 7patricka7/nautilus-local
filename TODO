For tasks outside the porting effort, we track them as bugs in
http://bugzilla.gnome.org.

Porting tasks. Some are necessary and some are just cleanup.

- Get EelLabel working and switch back to it on the sidebar.
- Get rid of all the direct freetype use and switch to using
  Pango instead.
- Visit all the destroy and move things into finalize or dispose
  and make them callable twice as appropriate.
- Change things that use destroy handlers to use weak references
  instead.
