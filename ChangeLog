	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-metafile.c:
	(set_metadata_eat_value): Fixed use of hash table in here. The
	old code would destroy the wrong key. (Thanks to Ian for pointing
	that when you insert a value into GHashTable it keeps the old key
	instead of overwriting with the new one.)
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_gtk_signal_connect_free_data):
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c: (attach_value_field),
	(create_emblems_page), (add_permissions_row_label):
	* src/nautilus-link-set-window.c: (make_link_set_check_box):
	* src/nautilus-property-browser.c:
	(make_properties_from_directory_path),
	(make_properties_from_xml_node), (make_category_link):
	* src/nautilus-sidebar.c: (nautilus_sidebar_add_panel_items):
	Got rid of unnecessary casts to (GtkDestroyNotify).

	* components/services/install/command-line/.cvsignore:
	* components/services/install/lib/.cvsignore:
	Ignore some additional generated files.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.c:
	Moved stock dialog functions to nautilus-stock-dialogs.[ch].
	(nautilus_gnome_canvas_item_request_update_deep),
	(nautilus_gnome_canvas_request_update_all),
	(nautilus_gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region),
	(nautilus_gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region_left_justify):
	Added a bunch of functions that were previously private inside
	NautilusIconContainer.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_gtk_adjustment_set_value),
	(nautilus_gtk_adjustment_clamp_value):
	Added functions that treat the value range in a GtkAdjustment the
	same way scroll bars do, taking the page size into account.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-horizontal-splitter.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-horizontal-splitter.c:
	(nautilus_horizontal_splitter_initialize),
	(toggle_splitter_position),
	(nautilus_horizontal_splitter_button_press),
	(nautilus_horizontal_splitter_button_release):
	Fixed logic so that splitter will only open or close if you both
	click and release within the splitter itself.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-private.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	(icon_toggle_selected): Move icons to front when they are selected.
	(set_scroll_region): Moved workaround that sets scroll region to
	be large enough to fill the widget allocation into a function in
	nautilus-gnome-extensions.h. In the process, I fixed the problem
	where it would do the job wrong when the view was zoomed.
	(lay_down_icons), (relayout), (reload_icon_positions):
	Started work on sharing code between automatic layout of the entire
	container and layout of new icons as the arrive.
	(nautilus_icon_container_clear), (nautilus_icon_container_add):
	Got started on the mechanism for laying out new icons as they arrive
	in bunches instead of one at a time.

	(nautilus_error_dialog_parented), (nautilus_yes_no_dialog),
	(nautilus_yes_no_dialog_parented):
	Moved all the stock dialog code in here.
	
	* src/nautilus-sidebar-title.c: (update_icon): Only display the
	icon when it's ready, instead of showing generic document icon
	before that time.
	(update_title), (update_more_info), (update_emblems),
	(update_notes): Added FIXMEs about doing the same with other info.

	half-baked code in here.

2000-06-26  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added the previous ChangeLogs to

	of the ./configure process.
	
	* helper-utilities/authenticate/nautilus-authenticate.h:
	Include <stdlib.h> for compiling with -Werror without error.
	
2000-06-26  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* acconfig.h:
	* configure.in:
	Fix build breakage caused recent changes to make GnomeVFS compile
	without OAF support. Some GnomeVFS headers now require USING_OAF
	to be defined and when included from Nautilus, this define was
	missing. Not sure this is the 100% correct way to do this but
	this should at least prevent people from being stuck with a broken
	build.

2000-06-26  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	Added XML-based theme mechanism and used it for the sidebar
	background, which isn't entirely working yet.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/default.xml:
	* icons/eazel/Makefile.am:
	* icons/eazel/eazel.xml:

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-item.c,h:
	(preferences_item_construct), (preferences_item_create_theme):

	Added a routine to access child nodes.
	* src/nautilus-sidebar.c: (nautilus_sidebar_initialize),
	(nautilus_sidebar_destroy), (nautilus_sidebar_read_theme),
	(nautilus_sidebar_theme_changed),
	(nautilus_sidebar_background_changed),
	(nautilus_sidebar_update_info):
	Made the sidebar get its default values from an XML-based theme
	file, and reload them when the theme changes.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-link.c:
	(free_icon_notification_info), (icon_read_done_callback),
	(is_remote_uri), (nautilus_link_get_image_uri):
	Linksets now use gnome-vfs to load load icons over http instead of
	ghttp, using Darin's new utility routines.  Also, made it load
	them asynchronously.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	(nautilus_icon_factory_get_pixbuf_for_icon):
	Made get_pixbuf_for_icon set the custom boolean when it calls
	get_icon_from_cache if necessary.

	* ChangeLog-20000625: Split up the ChangeLog.
