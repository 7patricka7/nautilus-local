        <title>Nautilus and Eazel Services</title>


	<para>
	Eazel Services are an Internet-based suite of tools 
	designed to simplify system management in 
	Linux. Nautilus and Eazel Services work together: 
	one complements the other. This chapter presents 
	a description of Eazel Services available for 
	the preview release two.
	</para>

	<para>
	For this release, Services will include:

	<title>Accessing Services</title>

	<para>
	There are several ways to access Eazel Services. 
	When starting Nautilus for the first time, the user 
	is asked if they wish to learn about, sign up, or 
	login to Services (Figure 1). 
	</para>

        <para>
	Upon choosing <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, the user is immediately 
	taken to the Services registration screen.
	</para>

	<para>
	On a routine basis, Services can be reached by 
	simply clicking the Services icon on the Nautilus 
	toolbar. Alternatively, they can be reached 
	through any web browser.
	</para>

	<title>Registration</title>

	<para>
	Registration is not required for all services, but is 
	for some. In this preview release, registration is 
	not required to use the software catalog; users 
	may even download RPMs without registering. 
	However, registration is required to use the Eazel 
	Software Installer (which has added function-
	ality), and for Eazel Online Storage.
	</para>

	<para>
	Beside the ability to use the Installer, registration 
	also brings the benefit of being able to download 
	the latest version of Nautilus. Other advantages 
	will follow.
	</para>

	<para>
	Registration is a relatively painless procedure, but 
	the user must complete the process by activating 
	their account with the instructions sent in a 
	validation e-mail. The instructions are sent almost 
	instantaneously.
	</para>

	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	<title>Eazel Software Catalog</title>

	<para>
	The Software Catalog is an on-line catalog of 
	Linux software, both Open Source and 
	commercial, that have made it through Eazel's 
	quality assurance process, and are guaranteed to 
	install and work properly on your system.
	</para>

	<para>
	The software is in RPM format.
	</para>

	<para>
	The user is able to select software in a variety of 
	ways, from functional categories, from special 
	Eazel recommendations, or from distributions. In 
	addition, there is a search feature, and a sort 
	feature for easier browsing.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each selected software package has three 
	available views, each providing more detail than 
	the last. The default view will be determined by 
	the user setting (basic, intermediate, or hacker)
	which the user selected during registration or 
	within Nautilus.
	</para>
	
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	<title>Eazel Software Installer</title>

	<para>
	The Installer takes into account your distribution, 
	version, and current system, and installs not only 
	the chosen programs, but also automatically 
	installs the necessary dependencies.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	This is all accomplished with the help of a client-
	side inventory program built into Nautilus,
	making Nautilus an integral part of Eazel 
	Services.
	</para>
	
	</sect1>

	<sect1>
	<title>Eazel Online Storage</title>

	<para>
	This service provides remote backup. Files are 
	backed up and saved on Eazel's servers, but 
	management is exactly the same as if the backup 
	were on the users own local drive.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Initially, Online Storage will offer each user a 
	free 25MB of storage space, to grow as the system 
	matures.
	</para>

	<para>
	Online Storage is more than just a one-directory 
	file repository. Users can create online folders:
	even entire directory trees. They can upload and 
	download files, and Nautilus users can copy or 
	move entire folders from their own system to 
	Eazel Online-Line Storage, and back again.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	There is also provision for sharing stored files 
	with other users.
	</para>
