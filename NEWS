Nautilus 1.0.3 was released May 8. We have some speedups to do and
some other small problems to fix, and then perhaps we'll release a
Nautilus 1.0.4. We may also want to remove some Eazel-specific stuff
that doesn't make sense any more.

We won't be porting Nautilus to GNOME 2 until the library freeze date
(at the request of the library developers, Michael Meeks mainly) so
this is still a GNOME 1 source tree for now.
