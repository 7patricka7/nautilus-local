	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.h:
	After a chat with Rebecca, named nautilus_str_underscore_escape to
	nautilus_str_double_underscores since the latter name more
	accurately describes what it does.
	(nautilus_str_double_underscores): Changed the function to allow
	NULL and return NULL instead of doing g_return_val_if_fail.
	(Also reformatted a bit and made a few gratuitous changes.)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.h:
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_menu_display_name):
	Moved the logic about escaping menu characters up one level so
	the bookmark class doesn't have to know about it. This removes
	the function from NautilusBookmark completely.

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(append_bookmark_to_menu): Fixed a storage leak and moved the
	double-underscore escaping in here.

2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>

	Fixed test cases on nautilus-string.c to be correct
	
2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>

        Bookmarks with '_' characters display
	correctly now on menus
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c
	New function to escape '_' characters in strings
	for menu display
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c
	New function to take bookmarks and return
	'_' escaped names
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c
	Calls function to escape bookmark names

2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Finished task 174 (Use deferred calculation to compute directory
	counts).

	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-attributes.h: 
	Added a header file for names of file attributes.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h: 
	Added background computation of the "directory item count"
	attribute. This is serving as a test case for the API for
	requesting additional information.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(display_selection_info): Changed to use the new interface that
	can sometimes return "I don't know" for the number of items in
	a particular directory.
	(stop_load), (done_loading), (display_pending_files),
	(fm_directory_view_stop): Fixed a mistake in the old code where
	we stopped monitoring once the files were discovered. We need to
	keep monitoring.
	(finish_loading_uri): Pass in an attribute that we want to monitor:
	NAUTILUS_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY_ITEM_COUNT.

        Bookmarks with '_' characters display
	correctly now on menus
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c
	New function to escape '_' characters in strings
	for menu display
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c
	New function to take bookmarks and return
	'_' escaped names
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c
	Calls function to escape bookmark names

Fri Apr 14 16:35:32 2000  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-rsvg.c: Added a command line tester for rsvg, which
	outputs alpha-transparent PNG's from SVG input files. The PNG save
	code is lifted from similar code in nautilus-icon-factory, and
	should be deleted when this functionality appears in gdk-pixbuf.

	* librsvg/Makefile.am: Build test-rsvg.

2000-04-14  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	using Raph's new machinery, made icons for .svg files use 
	a rendering of the file itself.
	
2000-04-14  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c (nautilus_window_constructed): Change the
	packing of the first pane so that it doesn't autoresize.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.c
	(nautilus_user_top_directory): Change this routine to use
	gnome_datadir_file to get the share directory.  Also, change to
	using g_strdup_printf.

2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/.cvsignore: Fixed to match new directory
	contents.

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Split libnautilus into two pieces.  

	libnautilus now only contains the view interfaces needed by nautilus 
	components.

	These are the interfaces defined in nautilus-view-component.idl.
	
	libnautilus-extensions containes the remainder of the stuff.

	Also used the cvs repository munging opportunity to do some of the
	ntl-* renaming outlined in the RENAIMING file.

2000-04-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* configure.in : Added tr to ALL_LINGUAS .

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* po/ChangeLog: Added this thing to make 'make dist' happy.

	Use that from now on for changes in po/.  Seems to be the standard
	thing to do.
	
2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus/libnautilus.h
	  libnautilus/nautilus-zoomable.h
	  libnautilus/ntl-view-frame.h:

	Include the new <nautilus-view-component.h> instead of
	<nautilus.h>
	
	  src/ntl-uri-map.h
	  src/ntl-view.h:

	Same.
	
2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:

	Did not build on redhat 5.2 because RPMTAG_FILENAMES has been
	obseleted in the version of rpm that ships with 5.2 apparently.
	I added a dumb hack to define RPMTAG_FILENAMES to
	RPMTAG_OLDFILENAMES which is almost surely the wrong thing to do,
	but i really need to have nautilus building while i do the
	nautilus view changes.  I gave myself a bug to properly address
	this soon (472).
	
2000-04-14  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* ChangeLog-20000414: rolled over from ChangeLog.
