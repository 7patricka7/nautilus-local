Nautilus Services packaging :

Packages
--------
Two base packages:
	eazel-services
	nautilus

we should keep the seperate services in seperate packages, that way
people can install the service they actually want, and loose the rest.

package eazel-services
----------------------
should contain the IDL specs for the toplevel interface(s), and the
shared functions eg. for authentication for root access.

package nautilus
----------------

the nautilus fm itself

-

Then if we keep each service in its own package (two a piece), we'll
get

timeservice:
	eazel-service-time
	nautilus-eazel-service-time-view

where eazel-service-time should contain the corba object plus the
command line thingy. nautilus-eazel-service-time-view should contain
the relevant nautilus components.

In this way, people can install just the cli tools and skip the
graphical tool. The tradeoff is the vast number of rpms, it'll be just
a minumum for 4 for having just nautilus and one service.On the other
hand, you can install naughtyloos with just 1 rpm and not have too
much superfluous stuff, and that you can install the services (cli
versions only) without all the gui stuff.  

Another benefit is the ability to update the individual services
without too much download.

The alternative is keeping one gigantic rpm with nautilus and all the
eazel services. Here the downsides are massive downloads when updating
even small parts, lack of ability to only install the parts you want.
The upside is, fewer packages to confuse the user.
