Nautilus 1.0.3 was released May 8. We have some speedups to do and
some other small problems to fix, and then perhaps we'll release a
Nautilus 1.0.4. We may also want to remove some Eazel-specific stuff
that doesn't make sense any more.

We won't be porting Nautilus to GNOME 2 until the library freeze date
(at the request of the library developers, Michael Meeks mainly) so
this is still a GNOME 1 source tree for now.

Changes since Nautilus 1.0.3:

	Fixes to bugs and other changes to speed up Nautilus's
	display of new directories (Yoann, Darin, Maciej)

	FreeBSD compile fixes (Darin, Gene)

	Fixes to compile with C compilers that don't allow empty
	structures (Darin)

	Fix to the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME setting code to make the Mozilla
	component work in more configurations. (peter@ximian.com, Darin)

	Make thumbnails always go in the home directory if "Make
	Folder Appearance Details
	Public" is set to Never (John, Michael Rothwell)

	Fixed a few small i18n problems. (Darin)

	Use Bonobo to handle additional key bindings, instead of using
	our own hack code. (Darin)

	Make default Web Search use google instead of the defunct
	Eazel search page. (Darin)

	Fix bug reading track info from MP3 files. (Jon K Hellan)

	Make News panel flash less. (Andy)

	Fixed bug in throbber destruction process (Darin, Owen)

	Added prelighting and tracking to the throbber (Anders, Darin)

	Use Control keys rather than Alt keys to move around in the
	file manager windows because Sawfish changed to use Alt again
	(John Harper)

	Fix MIME bug that might lead to the wrong default component
	getting used. This could have been what caused some people to
	get the text view instead of the web page view. (Darin)

	(Johan Dahlin, Darin)

	Install IDL files for non-C component programmers (Johan
	Dahlin, Darin)

	Some other small bug fixes (Juan Pablo Mendoza,
	limval@yahoo.com, Frederic Devernay, Darin)
