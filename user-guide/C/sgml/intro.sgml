	<sect1 id="intro-fsf">
	<title>Free Software</title>

	<para>
	Like Linux and GNOME, Nautilus is Free Software, a method 
	of software distribution which encourages innovation, improvement 
	and timely bug fixes, and to which Eazel, Inc., the Nautilus 
	maintainer, is committed.
	</para>

	<para>
	Fundamentally, the General Public License (or 
	GPL, under which Linux, GNOME and Nautilus 
	are licensed), insists that an application must always 
	be accompanied by its source code, that the 
	code can be freely modified, and that the user (or 
	purchaser) of software distributed under this license 
	agrees to in turn distribute their own source 
	code under the same license, when distributing, or 
	selling, a modified application.
	</para>


	<para>
	It can be seen that distributing software under the 
	GPL license does not prohibit selling software, 
	and in fact many companies do sell Linux distributions 
	and applications. The license does insist 
	on the free sharing, and distribution, of source 
	code. And it is this open code distribution 
	policy which the Free Software movement believes 
	will eventually result in more innovatory, less 
	troublesome, and more useful software.
	</para>
	</sect1>


	<sect1 id="intro-history">
	<title>Nautilus History</title>

	<para>
	Nautilus can trace its Free Software lineage back 
	to the text-based Midnight Commander file man-
	ager (still available on some Linux distributions). 
	The X Window version followed. Developing 
	from that base, Eazel has produced in Nautilus a 
	next-generation GUI that integrates file management, 
	web browsing, and system management.
	</para>

	</sect1>



	<sect1 id="intro-platforms">
	<title>Supported Platforms and Distributions</title>

	<para>
	Although initially developed on the Red Hat 6.2 
	Linux platform, Nautilus is being written for 
	cross-platform and multi-version operability in 
	short, to operate on every platform that GNOME 
	will operate on.
