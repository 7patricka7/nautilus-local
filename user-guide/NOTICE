This directory is deprecated, and will become dead in the future.
It currently should only hold "gnufdl" and "gnugpl".  These two 
directories will also become deprecated after GNOME 1.4 is out because
gnome-core will ship with copies of the FDL and GPL which other 
app's docs can link to.  So, please don't add anything or any translations
to this path.
