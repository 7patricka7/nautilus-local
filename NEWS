We're working on the next Nautilus release right now.
It will most-likely be called Nautilus 1.0.3.

A lot of features have gone in since Nautilus 1.0.2. These include:

	- don't allow desktop icons to be under the Panel
	- cut, copy, and paste for moving or copying files (a la Windows)
	- notice changes to files made outside Nautilus using the FAM
	  library if it's present
	- icon in title of Notes sidebar panel if the location has notes
	- Scripts menu to make it easy to run selected scripts on any
	  file; a new way to extend Nautilus
	- a News sidebar panel that displays headlines from web sites
	  that use the RSS format

	- tree view is faster, and also doesn't run at all unless it's
	  opened, so it doesn't slow things down when you don't use it
	- improved rubber-banding speed (in smooth mode)
	- other small speed improvements
	- faster JPEG thumbnailing (contributed by Alexander Larsson)

	- ~/.gnome-desktop directory is now used for the desktop instead
	  of ~/.nautilus/desktop. This change and others, done by Miguel,
	  were in the Nautilus from Ximian's GNOME 1.4 packages, and his
	  changes are now integrated into Nautilus 1.0.3.
	- more icons and descriptions for more types of removable media
	- xalf support in code that launches new programs; since there
	  are still many small problems with xalf, this is only on if
	  you set up a NAUTILUS_USE_XALF environment variable
	- added a "--no-desktop" option for the command line that makes
	  desktop-related preferences disappear and prevents Nautilus
	  from trying to manage the desktop -- good for running under KDE

	- Preferences menu now named "Preferences" instead of icon
	- preference to turn emacs keybindings on (for location field in
	  the location bar, and elsewhere)
	- improved preferences for font and font size
	- global view preferences, including global default zoom level
	- preference to always sort folders first
	- preference to add a "Delete" command that bypasses the trash
	- icon caption setting moved into Preferences dialog
	- Nautilus Themes setting moved into Preferences dialog
	- support for HTTP proxies that require a user name and password
	- preference for maximum image size for thumbnailing (and upped
	  default from 1 MB to 3 MB)
	- preference for experts who want to use their home directory for
	  the desktop

	- add "View as" items to menu bar
	- put ellipses ("...") in the middle of file names, not the
	  start (or end)
	- made copy progress dialog hang around for a second even if
	  the copy is faster than 1 second
	- list menu emblem column has a title and is after the file
	  name column
	- select folder or file you came from when you do Up command
	- sort tree view more like how we sort other views
	- draw tree view icons smoothly when smooth mode is on
	- less flicker in tree view display
	- add a way to go to a specific location even when the location
	  bar is hidden that doubles as a way to set the keyboard focus
	  to the location in the location bar
	- improved look of help on sidebar by using icons instead of
	  using slanted text
	- new implementation of audio preview that is faster and better
	- improved Open command, including a keyboard shortcut for the
	  Open in New Window command
	- show target path in properties window for symlinks
	- updated dragging code to use the same kind of slightly
	  broken URLs that gmc produces, which makes it compatible
	  with programs that previously worked with gmc and not Nautilus
	- handle drags of URLs onto the desktop by making Nautilus links

	- nautilus code broken out into librsvg, eel, and trilobite

and others.

Also, a *ton* of bug fixes and internal improvements have been done
that I won't try to list here (see ChangeLog).
