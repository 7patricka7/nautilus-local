Hi everybody.

The first preview source code release of Nautilus is here. Nautilus is a
graphical shell and file manager for GNOME. This preview release is a
snapshot of Nautilus development.

Nautilus is not yet ready for daily use. Intrepid hackers may want to get
and build this preview to get an idea of what Nautilus will be like.

    You can get the Nautilus 0.1 tarball here:

    <ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/nautilus>
        (mirrored at <http://download.eazel.com/source>)

    A number of other packages are needed too, including the
    latest releases of libghttp, oaf, gconf, gnome-vfs, bonobo,
    gtkhtml, and medusa. The README file inside the tarball
    contains a complete list.

    The Nautilus web site at <http://nautilus.eazel.com> contains
    pointers to our mailing list, screen shots, and other information.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes and
contributed to Nautilus so far. Here's a partial list:
