Get the gnome.m4 file from gnome-libs HEAD, and stick it in your $(prefix)/share/aclocal
directory. I hope you know how to get aclocal to find the .m4 files

Install ORBit, gtkhtml, gnome-vfs and bonobo from CVS.

If you can't figure it out from those instructions, too bad. :)

All patches should go through nautilus-maint@gnome.org
