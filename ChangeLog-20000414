	* components/Makefile.am: Turn on compilation of hyperbola component.
	* components/help/*: Compile and run.
	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view-client.c: Create & set the property bag if it doesn't exist.
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c: Load the hyperbola nav tree component as a test meta view.
	* src/ntl-view.c: Fill in NULL fields with empty strings, so that ORBit doesn't segfault.
	* src/ntl-window-msgs.c: When creating new meta views, they should
	be meta views and not content views (cut & paste error).
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: Don't redisplay every time a new entry comes in.

1999-12-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: Turned "-Wshadow" and "-Wundef" off for now, since they
	fire in some existing code.
	* gnome-icon-container.c: (handle_icon_button_press): Null out the drag
	variables before sending the activate signal. This makes activating an
	icon with a double-click work without crashing.
	* ntl-main.c: (main): Make critical and warning messages fatal if
	NAUTILUS_DEBUG is set in the environment. Make sure you have a new
	gnome-vfs that doesn't use g_warning for status messages.
	* ntl-window-msgs.c: (nautilus_window_change_location_internal):
	Made the history store away the current position as the new "previous"
	instead of storing away the new position. This makes the forward and
	back buttons work better.
	* ntl-window.c: (nautilus_window_back, nautilus_window_fwd):
	Had to make a corresponding change here after the change to the
	history mechanism.
	* fm-directory-view.c: (display_selection_info): Some fixes to the
	selection info display: "file"/"files" was backwards, text said "in"
	before the file size, and the display was not cleared when the
	selection was made empty. I still see problems where the selection
	info gets cleared when the window is lowered and then raised.

	* my first change: changed ntl-window-state.c
	(nautilus_window_set_initial_state): changed initial path
	to be the user's home directory, getting rid of confusing "localhost"
	 
1999-12-15  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Add --enable-more-warnings and --enable-fatal-warnings switches.
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c: Add comment about functionality-in-waiting. 

1999-12-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c (gtk_scroll_frame_size_allocate):
        Rolled out my change. I was confused. Elliot had this fixed
        already but I forgot to "make install".

1999-12-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c (gtk_scroll_frame_size_allocate):
        Fixed overflow problem caused by gint16 local variable.

1999-12-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c (nautilus_window_constructed):
        Fixed signal handler to point to nautilus_window_goto_url_cb
        instead of nautilus_window_goto_url. This was causing a bad
        cast when a new URL was typed.

1999-12-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (nautilus_navinfo_new): Changed back to
        const gchar*. To compile, you need to install the latest
        gnome-vfs.

1999-12-15  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c: Fix size_allocate.

1999-12-14  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (nautilus_navinfo_new): a const char* can't be
	passed where a gchar* is expected.

1999-12-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: Turned on more warnings, including -Werror.
	  I found one or two real bugs, and made some minor changes
	  to quiet the compiler so I could turn on some useful warnings
	  that triggered on the existing code.
	
	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c: (handle_xfer_vfs_error):
	  Fixed a place where it was calling the gnome error(), but using
	  the parameters from the old gnome-fm error() function.

	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view-client.c:
	  (nautilus_meta_view_set_label): Fixed a place where we
	  were passing in string literals to code that will free them.
	  We need to call g_strdup before passing them to gnome_property_bag_add.

	* libnautilus/gnome-icon-container.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/gtkscrollframe.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-content-view-client.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-view-client.c: Fixed a warning.
	* libnautilus/ntl-content-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-main.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-meta-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-types.h: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-view.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/ntl-window.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer-progress-dialog.c: Fixed a warning.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-cache.c: Fixed a warning.

1999-12-14  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* src/*.c: Restructure the whole NautilusWindow code for sanity's sake.
	* src/ntl-uri-map.[ch]: Instead of just passing in various pieces of information about the old URL,
	  pass in the Nautilus_NavigationInfo that has to be kept around anyways.
	* idl/nautilus.idl: Allow a selection to be multiple URI's.

1999-12-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c: (nautilus-window-constructed): Forward-button signal
	was connected with NULL parameter instead of window. Fixed that so it
	has a chance of working.

	* .cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* components/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* help/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* history/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* icons/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* idl/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* libnautilus/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* src/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.
	* src/file-manager/.cvsignore: Ignore more generated files.

1999-12-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c: (nautilus-window-constructed): Reordered option menu
	creation code to fix bug where it wasn't sizing itself properly. Changed
	label of placeholder item and desensitized it to make it more obvious that
	it's a non-working placeholder.

1999-12-14  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, icons/: Add icons

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: Everything goes inside the scroll-frame, not the view itself.

1999-12-13  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* libnautils/g*.[ch]: Switch from imlib to pixbuf.
	* src/file-manager: Import from gnome-fm.

	* idl/nautilus.idl: Add a 'main_window' attribute on a ViewFrame, so that views can talk to the main window.

1999-12-10  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* libnautilus/ntl-meta-view.[ch]: Add a convenience function for
	setting the label.

	* Throughout: Rename the meta view "description" property to "label",
	which more accurately describes its use.

	* components/help: Start turning hyperbola into component.

1999-12-09  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* Start migration from gnome-fm.

src/explorer-location-bar.[ch]:
	Copy over from gnome-fm, change signal to include new URI.
src/ntl-window.c:
	Make NautilusWindow use it.
