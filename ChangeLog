2001-05-31  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: (update_title): Missed a
	place that required a non-NULL sidebar. Thanks to Miguel
	Rodriguez Perez <migras@atlas.uvigo.es> for pointing it out.

2001-05-31  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	Fixed a bug where the MIME type components short list query was
	not sorted. This could result in the wrong default component being
	selected, and may be the problem that caused some users to get the
	text component instead of the Mozilla web page component.

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-mime-actions.c:
	(nautilus_mime_get_default_component_for_file_internal): Update
	since nautilus_do_component_query no longer takes an &ev.
	(nautilus_mime_get_short_list_applications_for_file): Remove
	unused ev variable. Fix problem where the user's added items would
	be added in reverse order.
	(build_joined_string): New helper function.
	(nautilus_mime_get_short_list_components_for_file): Update since
	nautilus_do_component_query no longer takes an &ev. Pass in a
	sorting order to the query so we don't lose the order of the short
	list.
	(nautilus_mime_actions_file_needs_full_file_attributes): Update
	since nautilus_do_component_query no longer takes an &ev.
	(nautilus_mime_get_all_components_for_file): Update since
	nautilus_do_component_query no longer takes an &ev.
	(mime_get_all_components_for_uri_scheme): Update since
	nautilus_do_component_query no longer takes an &ev.
	(nautilus_do_component_query): Update to use its own &ev instead of
	take one passed in. None of the callers were looking at the &ev.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory-async.c: Bumped the
	number of items per call back up. Now that we've done other bug
	fixes, this makes things faster overall, not slower, although it
	does make the time until the first icon shows up a bit longer.
	
	* src/nautilus-sidebar-title.c: (nautilus_sidebar_title_set_file):
	Don't monitor the directory item count. If the main view monitors
	it we'll display it. If the main view doesn't, we'll show the old
	"last known" value or nothing. It's better to do less I/O and
	sometimes be wrong than do more I/O to always be right in this
	case.
	
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (add_sidebar_panel_callback),
	(nautilus_window_initialize), (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_add_sidebar_panel),
	(update_sidebar_panels_from_preferences),
	(nautilus_window_hide_sidebar), (nautilus_window_show_sidebar),
	(nautilus_window_sidebar_showing):
	Simplify sidebar logic. Among other things, we no longer create an
	invisible sidebar for the desktop.

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(in_single_click_mode): Use "(void)", not "()".
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	(nautilus_icon_container_did_not_drag): Coding style tweak.

2001-05-29 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	Initial checkin of gnome-db2html3, the new DocBook xml->html converter

	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html3/
	  gnome-db2html3.c, README, AUTHORS
	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html3/gnome-customization,
	  which contains GNOME customization stylesheet
	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html3/docbook/, which
	  contains Norman Walsh's xsl stylesheet extravaganza

	(the actual checkin was done the 29th, but there was a lock on the
	ChangeLog, which is why this is being checked in a day later)
	
2001-05-23  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-global-preferences.c: Added a
	default for the ADD_TO_SESSION preference. This should fix the
	problem where some people don't get any session
	management. Miguel's patch removed the code to set this preference
	in the first time druid so we need to default to TRUE.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_get_string_attribute_with_default): Used return
	statements to simplify the logic a bit.

2001-05-22  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	Fallout from fixing bug 8220 (Having Ctrl as default "modifier
	key used for default WM shortcuts" breaks everything...):

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-container.c
	(keyboard_space, keyboard_move_to): changed to use Control
	modifier instead of Alt

2001-05-22  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed problem compiling with new gettext:

	* hack-macros/gnome.m4: Add BUILD_INCLUDED_LIBINTL for
	compatibility with the new gettext.
	
	Fixed a problem with the throbber detecting that its X window is
	gone. Based on suggestions from Owen Taylor.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-bonobo-workarounds.h:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-bonobo-workarounds.c:
	(destroy_later_callback), (destroyed_before_timeout_callback),
	(nautilus_bonobo_object_force_destroy_later): Changed to "destroy
	later" instead of "destroy at idle". This makes us less likely to
	experience race conditions.

	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_initialize_class),
	(nautilus_window_unrealize), (nautilus_window_destroy): Moved the
	throbber destruction to unrealize so we destroy the throbber
	before we destroy its X window.

	Starting with patch by Anders Carlsson <andersca@gnu.org>, added
	both prelighting and tracking to the throbber, also making it take
	action on release, not press.

	* components/throbber/nautilus-throbber.c:
	(nautilus_throbber_initialize_class): Add handlers for enter,
	leave, and release.
	(nautilus_throbber_initialize): Set flags so we get enter and
	leave events.
	(select_throbber_image): Ref the image that's returned.
	(draw_throbber_image): Make the image be prelit if the mouse is
	over the throbber but it wasn't clicked, and darkened if the mouse
	is over the throbber and it was clicked.
	(nautilus_throbber_enter_notify_event): Set flag and request
	redraw to prelight.
	(nautilus_throbber_leave_notify_event): Set flag and request
	redraw to un-prelight.
	(nautilus_throbber_button_press_event): Set flag to indicate we
	hit the button in the throbber. Also, respond only to left clicks.
	(nautilus_throbber_button_release_event): Look at flag set in
	press event. Do the work here now instead of at press time since
	we are more like a real button.

	Rolled in change by Miguel Rodríguez Pérez <migrax@terra.es> to
	fix volume mounting problems:

	* configure.in: Check for hasmntopt.
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-volume-monitor.c:
	(get_removable_volumes): Fix typo (HAVE_MNTTENT_H ->
	HAVE_MNTENT_H).
	
	Integrated patch by Miguel Rodríguez Pérez <migrax@terra.es> to
	make Nautilus not try to preview MPEG lists:

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(icon_container_preview_callback): Made audio/x-mpegurl another
	exception to the list of audio types we can preview.

	Rolled in change by Dennis Smit <synap@area101.penguin.nl>:
 
	* THANKS: added more translators that were missing from the
	THANKS file (names from all the .po files in ./po).

	Other updates to THANKS:

	* THANKS: Added Jon K Hellan.
 	* check-THANKS.pl: Fixed logic so you can be credited as both an
	author and translator.

	Other changes:

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (get_default_zoom_level): Fix
	typo (storaged -> storage).
	
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml:
	Fixed keybindings entries to use the correct tags as described by
	ui-xml.txt.

2001-05-21  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	made the news panel flash less by defering async updates with a timer
	task, so ones that fire close together are coalesced.
	
	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (do_destroy),
	(rss_logo_callback), (update_timeout_callback),
	(queue_update_size_and_redraw), (rss_read_done_callback),
	(make_remove_widgets), (make_news_view):

2001-05-18  Yoann Vandoorselaere  <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>

	Code reviewed by Darin Adler <darin@bentspoon.com>.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (display_pending_idle_callback): 
	return TRUE if real_display_pending_files() return FALSE which mean 
	that there is other icon to be drawn (the idle won't be removed until
	the idle callback return FALSE).

	return FALSE if real_display_pending_files() return TRUE, which mean
	all files were drawn.

2001-05-18  Jon K Hellan  <hellan@acm.org>

	Code reviewed by Darin Adler <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* components/music/mpg123.h (struct id3v1tag_t): Fix track info.
	(struct id3tag_t): Fix track info. Not tested for v2, but big
	enough for what can be represented in v1.1.

	* components/music/mpg123.c (mpg123_id3v1_to_id3v2): Fix track
	info. Track in id3v1.1 is an 8 bit integer, not a string.
	Track is still unimplemented for id3v2. I did not fix it, as I
	don't have examples to test with.

2001-05-18  Yoann Vandoorselaere  <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>

	Code reviewed by Darin Adler <darin@bentspoon.com>,
	also, thanks for the help solving this issue.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (g_list_split_off_first_n): 
	moved from fm-list-view.c.
	(real_display_pending_files): move the fm-list-view.c function to
	display pending file, but remove the clist sorting code.
	(FILES_TO_PROCESS_AT_ONCE): new constant, appear to be a better name
	than LIST_VIEW_DISPLAY_PENDING_FILES_GROUP_SIZE.

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c (LIST_VIEW_DISPLAY_PENDING_FILES_GROUP_SIZE): 
	removed this constant.
	(fm_list_view_display_pending_files): just sort the list by the clist criteria
	then call the parent function to display_pending_file.
	(g_list_split_off_first_n): removed.

	This should fix the issue where UI response (icon drawing) would take
	a long time because the directory loaded was cached by the kernel.
	We now draw with a fixed maximum number of files at once.
	
	The list view code was already doing that, so the code was just moved,
	and adaptated for use in directory view, so list view has the same 
	behavior as before without any code being duplicated.

2001-05-17  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Yoann and I did some more debugging and analysis and we stumbled
	over a bug that was responsible for some big slowdowns.

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(activation_uri_start): Fixed bug that was causing activation URI
	reads to work strangely.
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: (delete_callback),
	(bonobo_control_activate_callback), (fm_directory_view_destroy):
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_initialize_class),
	(nautilus_window_realize):
	Rip out keybinding hack and use Bonobo's (undocumented as far as I
	can tell) keybinding machinery instead.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-metafile.c: (schedule_next_read):
	Use (void), not ().
	
2001-05-17  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in:
	* nautilus.spec.in:
	Don't require ammonite any more in the default Nautilus RPM. I
	left the ability to compile ammonite support in for now. That can
	be removed at any time, but it doesn't hurt anybody.

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-global-preferences.c: Change default
	web search to use google instead of the defunct Eazel search page.

2001-05-16  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: Up version to 1.0.3.1 so we don't confuse cvs
	builds with the release.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_fit_date_as_string): Fix i18n problem by calling
	_() on strings before using.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: (key_press_event_callback),
	(bonobo_control_activate_callback), (fm_directory_view_destroy):
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_key_press_event):
	Change key press event callbacks to run only after the parent
	class. This makes keys go to the focused text field first, so
	hitting delete while editing a file name doesn't delete the file.

2001-05-16  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy), (activate_callback),
	(cancel_activate_callback), (fm_directory_view_activate_file),
	Got rid of monitor_file_for_activation, another example of this
	same loose end as last time.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c:
	(set_to_pending_location_and_selection): There was an overzealous
	assert in here. Looked into why it fired, and fixed it up.

2001-05-16  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: (free_location_change),
	(begin_location_change):
	Finished up a loose end from when I made the change to
	determine_initial_view to not get full attributes. This leftover
	code was causing an extra directory load.

	* THANKS: Added Yoann.
	
2001-05-15  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nautilus-sidebar.c: (notify_current_sidebar_view),
	(nautilus_sidebar_activate_panel),
	(nautilus_sidebar_deactivate_panel):
	at Darin's urging, coalesced the open and closed properties into a
	single one with a value.

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (get_bonobo_properties),
	(set_bonobo_properties), (nautilus_news_load_location):
	made it maintain the closed state and made load_location only redraw
	when opened.
	
2001-05-13  Yoann Vandoorselaere  <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory-async.c (DIRECTORY_LOAD_ITEMS_PER_CALLBACK): 
	Change from 32 item by callback to 10.
	This is much better for UI response time and will prevent having
	too much latency time when loading the directory.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (DISPLAY_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL_MSECS): 
	Change from 700 ms to 100 ms, this is much better for the user
	as he won't see any latency time before drawing start.

	Theses are the better experienced setting for now.
	
2001-05-13  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Integrated patch from Yoann Vandoorselaere
	<yoann@mandrakesoft.com>. Yoann found that double-clicking on on a
	directory would wait for all the files to be read in before
	displaying anything, while typing the path in the location bar
	would should proper progressive loading. This checkin solves that
	problem.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): Only call_when_ready on the
	minimum attributes, not full. All the checks in activate_callback
	only depend on the minimum attributes, and do not need the extra
	directory item mime types attribute.

2001-05-11  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>

	Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com> discovered that the
	code to load a directory was accidentally waiting for all the
	files to be read in before displaying anything. This fixes the two
	problems that caused that, but there are remaining loose ends
	(it's not entirely clear why View As Music is still showing
	properly in the View menu).

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory-private.h:
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(nautilus_directory_call_when_ready_internal): Take a parameter to
	say whether to wait for all the files in the file list, instead of
	deducing it from other parameters.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory.h:
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-directory.c:
	(nautilus_directory_call_when_ready): Take a parameter to say
	whether to wait for all the files in the file list, instead of
	deducing it from other parameters.
	(nautilus_self_check_directory): Pass TRUE so we wait for the file
	list.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-merged-directory.c:
	(merged_call_when_ready): Pass through the new boolean.
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-trash-file.c:
	(real_call_when_ready): Pass FALSE since there is no file list for
	a single file.
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-vfs-directory.c:
	(vfs_call_when_ready): Pass through the new boolean.
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-vfs-file.c:
	(vfs_file_call_when_ready): Pass FALSE since there is no file list
	for a single file.
	
	* src/nautilus-applicable-views.c:
	(nautilus_determine_initial_view),
	(nautilus_determine_initial_view_cancel): Removed the code to get
	full file attributes after getting the minimum required if
	nautilus_mime_actions_file_needs_full_file_attributes return
	TRUE. We want to make the choice fast, and it's OK if we choose
	poorly as a result. The question is whether this will cause any
	real end-user problems.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(call_when_ready_on_scripts_directory): Pass TRUE so we read the
	entire scripts directory.
	(load_directory): Pass FALSE so we don't wait for all the files to
	be loaded before starting to display them. This is the core of the
	fix.
	
	* components/tree/nautilus-tree-change-queue.c:
	(nautilus_tree_change_queue_enqueue): A place where we can use
	g_slist_prepend instead of g_slist_append.
	* src/nautilus-complex-search-bar.c:
	(nautilus_complex_search_bar_initialize): A place where we can use
	g_slist_prepend instead of g_slist_append.
	
2001-05-10  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made the thumbnail mechanism respect the "PUBLIC_METADATA"
	preference, so if you change "Make Folder Appearance Details
	Public" to Never (in Speed Tradeoffs at Advanced user level),
	thumbnails will always be created in ~/.nautilus/thumbnails,
	instead of in a .thumbnails subdirectory in each directory.
	Thanks to Michael Rothwell <rothwell@holly-springs.nc.us> for

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-thumbnails.h:

	Integrated a patch from peter@ximian.com to move the
	MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME-setting code from the main Nautilus program
	(where it does no good) to the Mozilla component (which is a nicer
	place for it anyway).

	While integrating the patch I made some other small cleanups to
	the Mozilla component and the patch itself. I removed the code to
	set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since it's not needed, and changed the name
	of some things and simplified others.

	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am: Define PREFIX.
	* components/mozilla/main.c: (is_good_mozilla_path),
	(get_mozilla_path), (set_up_MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME), (main): Add the
	new code to set up MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME.
	
	* src/nautilus-application.c: (finish_startup): Remove the code

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-volume-monitor.c:
	(has_removable_mntent_options), (get_removable_volumes),
	(volume_is_removable), (volume_is_read_only),
	(nautilus_volume_monitor_mount_unmount_removable),
	(nautilus_volume_monitor_get_mount_name_for_display): Added more
	ifdefs all over the place. This could be done more elegantly some
	day.

	Integrated patch by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>
	to fix a problem where we would try to get metadata for all files
	in the home directory if it was set to be used as the desktop
	directory.

	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-file-utilities.h:
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-file-utilities.c:
	(nautilus_get_desktop_directory): Changed this to not bother with
	the call to create the directory when the home directory is used
	as the desktop.
	(nautilus_get_gmc_desktop_directory): New function.
	
	* libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	(nautilus_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file): Use
	nautilus_get_gmc_desktop_directory for the check when deciding to
	look for old-fashioned gmc metadata.

	Fixed bug 8122 (Folders opened from the desktop should not
	reuse frontmost window). The previous behavior was intended to
	match the behavior of web browsers, but user feedback made it
	clear that it was confusing and annoying people too much.

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: 
	(get_topmost_nautilus_window_in_current_workspace_and_area):
	Removed this no-longer-needed function.
	(open_location): Always create a new window in the desktop case.

	Fix bug 8251 (Mozilla component crashes every time I try to view a
	web page) by putting the same logic for locating Mozilla that is
	used by galeon into Nautilus.

	* src/nautilus-application.c: (is_mozilla_path_good),
	(get_mozilla_path), (find_mozilla): Code to find Mozilla and set
	up some environment variables that matches the code in galeon's
	startup script.
	(finish_startup): New function for initialization code that should
	be done only in the main Nautilus, not in clients that are going
	to contact the main Nautilus. More initialization should be moved
	in here over time. Calls find_mozilla among other things.
	(nautilus_application_startup): Moved the sound initialization and
	the code to migrate desktop directory contents inside the new
	initialization function.

2001-05-07  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@rslomkow.org>

	changed "arlo/i-directory-aa.png" to "crux_eggplant/i-directory-aa.png"
	as the arlo directory has been renamed.

	More tweaking on keyboard shortcuts for deleting and trashing.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(ALL_NON_LOCK_MODIFIER_KEYS): Don't include MOD2, because it is
	"num lock". Don't include MOD3-5 because I don't know for sure if
	they are lock modifiers or not.
	(trash_or_delete_selected_files), (trash_callback): Separated out

	(make_icon_name_from_mime_type): Construct an icon name for types

	(load_icon_from_path): New function, share common code.
	(load_named_icon): New function, share common code.
	(load_specific_icon): Try icon based on MIME type first, then fall

	Fixed 4964 (Files dragged to Trash from floppy don't
		    appear in Trash Can)
	Fixed 7406 (Trash doesn't work until first restart of Nautilus)
	Fixed 7976 (some files that you can't leave in the Trash just
		    silently go away instead of showing the dialog as
		    they should)

	New trash directories are created lazily, when someone tries to
	delete an item on the respective disk for the first time. The
	problem was that these new trash directories do not get integrated
	into the unified trash directory. Added logic to do that.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	(nautilus_file_operations_copy_move):
	
	Before a move to trash operation is started check for any new
	trash directories and integrate them if needed.

2001-04-26  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Integrated Miguel's patches that he included in Ximian's version
	of Nautilus 1.0 after fixing some bugs, fixing all warnings, and
	adding code to not do the reload of the desktop every 4 seconds if
	FAM is working. The patch does a lot of things, mostly so that
	people can switch back and forth between gmc and nautilus more
	easily.
	
	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: Tweaked includes.
	* src/nautilus-view-frame.c: Tweaked a comment.

Here are notes Miguel included in the patch about the changes he made:

	entry.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c

	* src/nautilus-window.c (nautilus_window_realize): Use gnome-logo
	here.

	information from GNOME metadata as well.
	(icon_position_changed_callback): Store metadata changes to the
	desktop as well.

	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.c
	(nautilus_first_time_druid_show): Disable GMC transition page, as
	we now share the desktop directory and the data files.
	(druid_finished): Remove desktop link to Eazel services.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c
	(nautilus_file_can_rename): Do not allow to rename x-gnome-apps.

	file instead of the file name.  
	Handle URL files in .gnome-desktop directories. 
	(is_special_desktop_gmc_file): New function: Returns true if a
	file should be hidden from the desktop-directory display (for
	sharing the directory with gmc).
	(filter_hidden_and_backup_partition_callback): If we are scanning
	the desktop directory, hide gmc metadata files or legacy files.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c
	(activation_uri_gmc_link_read_callback): Handle GMC link files
	correctly (skip the prefix "URL: ")

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c

	.desktop files.

- 2001-04-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	nautilus api call, and instead just load this value once.

Here are changes that Miguel made, but did not mention in his notes:
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-volume-monitor.c: Changed
	the interval for polling to every 4 seconds instead of every 2.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: (nautilus_file_rename):
	Rename GMC URLs by changing their metadata only. This leaves no
	way to change the real name of the GMC URL file.
	(nautilus_file_is_in_desktop): New function. Returns TRUE if a
	file seems to be in the desktop. Uses a simple rule that might
	give some false positives, but works even for other people's
	desktop.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_destroy), (do_desktop_rescan),
	(done_loading), (delayed_init), (fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):

	Rename ~/.gnome-desktop/Trash to ~/.gnome-desktop/Trash-gmc if
	it's a directory. Move files from ~/.nautilus/desktop to
	~/.gnome-desktop.
	
2001-04-26  Dan Mueth  <dan@eazel.com>

	Updated Nautilus Release Notes for Nautilus 1.0.3.  It
	still will need some work and additions, but I have most
	of the boilerplate stuff and new features added.

	* help/nautilus-release-notes/C/nautilus-release-notes.sgml:

2001-04-26  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-group.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-group.h:
	Add support for custom preferences items.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-item.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-item.c:
	Add support for custom preferences items.  For now only the theme
	selector uses this powerful technology.

	Fix bug 8167 - Crash boinking on single-click mode.  It was a dumb
	mistake left over from a previous fix.  Wrong number of arguments
	to a signal.

	Fix bug where strings in enumeration menus would show up
	untranslated in the preferences dialog, even in locales where
	translations exist.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-theme.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-theme.c: (load_theme_document),
	(nautilus_pixmap_file_may_be_local),
	(nautilus_theme_get_image_path_from_theme),
	(nautilus_theme_make_preview_pixbuf): Rename this function from
	nautilus_theme_make_selector for greater clarity.
	(has_image_file), (theme_get_property), (theme_get_name_property),
	(theme_get_description_property), (theme_list_insert),
	(theme_get_themes_for_location): Replace some cut-n-paste code by
	a shared function.  Add some FIXMEs for the funky handling of the
	"default" theme.
	(theme_get_builtin_themes), (theme_get_user_themes),
	(theme_get_default_themes): Functions for reaping the
	different types of themes available to Nautilus.
	(nautilus_theme_for_each_theme), (theme_list_invoke_callback): New
	function to iterate all the themese available to Nautilus.  Makes
	Nautilus code that needs to operate on themes (like the theme
	selector) easier to write.
	(nautilus_theme_get_user_themes_directory),
	(nautilus_theme_remove_user_theme),
	(nautilus_theme_install_user_theme):  Functions for reaping the
	different types of themes available to Nautilus.
	
	* src/nautilus-preferences-dialog.c:
	(preferences_dialog_populate_sidebar_tabs_group),
	(theme_changed_callback),
	(update_theme_selector_displayed_value_callback),
	(preferences_dialog_populate_themes_group):
	Add a custom preference item for the theme chooser.
	
	* src/nautilus-theme-selector.h:
	* src/nautilus-theme-selector.c:
	Use regular Gtk widgets in the list so that all the things that
	are expect to work do indeed work.  This includes Gtk+ theme
	changes and custom tweaks made in the code to satisfy the design.
	Larger and bolder labels for example.

	Simplify this code alot by using iterators for the available
	themes.  Also maintain two lists instead of managing a remove_mode
	boolean.  Makes the code simpler.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(nautilus_window_initialize_menus_part_1):
	Remove the standalone theme selector handling code.
	
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:
	Remove the standalone theme selector ui.

2001-04-26  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made the emblems column wider to fit the title "Emblems" (in
	English, in the default font). Made the emblems column in the
	search results view match the one in the standard list view.

	Pavel wants to implement images as column titles, but this is
	passable if that doesn't get done.

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (real_get_column_specification):
	Widen the emblems column.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(real_get_emblems_column), 
	(real_get_link_column): Swap positions of name/emblems columns.
	(real_get_column_specification): Widen the emblems column.

2001-04-26  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Search results view has been broken for awhile without anyone
	noticing. Between these changes and a NULL-handling fix I
	checked into eel-list.c, it works again. (Soon I will move the
	Emblems column for search list view also, but first I wanted
	to make it work.)

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_view_initialize_class),
	(add_to_list), (install_row_images), (get_emblems_column),
	(real_get_emblems_column): Replaced #define for emblems column
	with overridable function.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class),
	(real_get_emblem_names_to_exclude), (real_get_emblems_column):
	Override get_emblems_column to return correct value.

2001-04-26  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Moved over a few changes from the nautilus-1 branch. 
	I've reviewed all the changes in the branch ChangeLog now,
	so I think we can kiss it goodbye.
	
	* configure.in: Bumped a bunch of version numbers to match
	branch. Robin may have to do some more bumping before 
	shipping 1.0.3.

	* help/nautilus-user-manual/C/figures/custicon.png:
	* help/nautilus-user-manual/C/figures/full.png:
	* help/nautilus-user-manual/C/figures/part.png:
	Smaller versions of screenshots which were too big to
	fit in the Nautilus main panel, by Arlo. (For some reason
	nautilus-quick-reference on HEAD had smaller figures than
	on nautilus-1, but vice-versa for nautilus-user-manual.)

	* src/nautilus-preferences-dialog.c:
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(nautilus_window_initialize_menus_part_1): Made Medusa stuff not
	appear when HAVE_MEDUSA is not defined.

	Other changes:
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c:
	(get_xalf_prefix): Bug fix from Darin (!= -> ==) that
	was breaking launching applications unless you had xalf
	installed (not from branch)

2001-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (nautilus_news_update_display):
	reversed decision about not drawing while the channel was loading
	since it's important to give feedback right away when a channel is
	enabled, and they sometimes takes a long time to load.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-sidebar-functions.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-sidebar-functions.h:
	enabled the news panel by default.  Also, while I was in here, I
	made the "home as desktop" feature only available at the advanced
	user level like Bud suggested.
	
2001-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (draw_rss_items),
	(nautilus_news_draw_channel), (nautilus_news_size_allocate):
	fixed measuring bug caused by the size of the scroll bar
	affecting the layout.  Fixed by calculating the line width at
	size_allocate time, instead of on the spur of the moment.
	
2001-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (draw_rss_logo_image),
	(draw_rss_items), (nautilus_news_configure_event),
	(nautilus_news_button_release_event), (update_size_and_redraw),
	(nautilus_news_size_allocate), (make_news_view):
	
	attach to size_allocate signal to properly resize the panel
	when the width changes, as well as for the first time when the
	size isn't allocated yet; don't draw the time when it overlaps
	the logo, plus other clean-ups.
	
	* nautilus-clean.sh:
	fixed recently introduced problem in nautilus-clean by replacing
	'==' with '=' as suggested by Darin.
	
2001-04-25  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@eazel.com>

	Adding version for 1.0.1 and 1.0.2.

2001-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c:
	(nautilus_news_button_release_event)
	fixed bug 8153, scroll wheel crashes news panel, by only
	taking action when button 1 is clicked.
		
	(add_site_from_fields):
	added error handling for when the fields are empty; also, use
	http as the protocol if no protocol is specified.
	
2001-04-25  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: (help_menu_about_nautilus_callback):
	Made the Copyright string translatable again, by popular demand.

2001-04-24  Dan Mueth  <dan@eazel.com>

	Left-justifying the labels in the help sidebar.
	Also changed strings to remove colons ":".
	Bug#: 8123

	* components/help/hyperbola-nav-tree.c:
	(hyperbola_navigation_tree_new):

	Updating so that 'make install' works right
	and users building RPM's don't get lots of warnings.
	Bug#: 8125

	* omf-install/Makefile.am:

	Changing from "Customer Support" to "Community Support".
	Bug#: 7837

	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:

2001-04-24  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 8152 (Opening Help sidebar crashes Nautilus):
	
	* src/nautilus-sidebar.c: (notify_current_sidebar_view): Add check
	for NIL control.

	* nautilus-clean.sh: Change egrep args so we get fewer false
	positives.
	
	* src/nautilus-view-frame.c: (nautilus_view_frame_get_control):
	Formatting tweaks.

2001-04-24  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: Maciej Stachowiak <mjs@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 7963 (exiting Nautilus [with Ctrl-C for example] leaves
	nautilus-adapter behind):

	* src/nautilus-component-adapter-factory.c: (activate_factory),
	(unref_factory), (release_factory), (get_corba_factory),
	(nautilus_component_adapter_factory_initialize),
	(nautilus_component_adapter_factory_destroy),
	(nautilus_component_adapter_factory_initialize_class),
	(component_adapter_factory_at_exit_destructor),
	(nautilus_component_adapter_factory_get),
	(nautilus_component_adapter_factory_create_adapter): Redo so it
	creates the factory as needed, and doesn't keep a Bonobo reference
	to the factory so it will die if Nautilus goes away.

	* nautilus-clean.sh: Redo option parsing to use loop.

	* components/throbber/main.c: (main): Fix main function to match
	standard main. Tweak formatting.
	
2001-04-24  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 8418 (two more underline-accelerator conflicts)

	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml: Changed
	"Make _Link" to "_Make Link" to avoid conflict with sometimes-
	present "De_lete"
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-icon-view-ui.xml: Changed
	"_Tighter Layout" to "Tighter _Layout" to avoid conflict
	with "By _Type".

2001-04-24  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed part of bug 7649 (sidebar font doesn't update when font
	changed in non-smooth mode) and various other small problems
	with fonts in sidebar. The font in the tabs is still always
	the smooth font.

	Also, made both default smooth and default non-smooth fonts
	visible simultaneously in the Preferences dialog since they
	are both used in different places at the same time. Maybe
	if we fix the sidebar tabs to not insist on using a smooth
	font we can turn these two controls back into one.

	* src/nautilus-preferences-dialog.c: Changed labels from
	"Font for elsewhere in Nautilus", which had become context-free,
	to "Default smooth font" and "Default non-smooth font". Made
	both of these always visible.
	
	* src/nautilus-sidebar-title.c:
	(nautilus_sidebar_title_initialize_class): Set up auto-variable
	to get default non-smooth font name so we don't have to call 
	get_preferences	repeatedly.
	(get_non_smooth_font): New helper function to get a non-smooth
	font of a specified size.
	(non_smooth_font_changed_callback): New function, updates the
	non-smooth font for the title and "more info" text.
	(update_all_cover): Removed this function.
	(nautilus_sidebar_title_initialize): Call new callback instead of
	update_all when non-smooth font changes. update_all was bailing
	out without doing any work since the text hadn't changed. Also
	call callback once to set the initial non-smooth font info.
	(update_title_font): Changed name from update_font for clarity;
	moved some consts to become #defines instead; fixed bug where 
	this routine wasn't using bold font for either smooth or non-smooth 
	font (2 unrelated bugs); removed unnecessary font-setting call 
	(smooth font is already set elsewhere and doesn't change here);
	remove unnecessary callback for NAUTILUS_PREFERENCES_SMOOTH_GRAPHICS_MODE
	since each label piece already handles this separately.
	(update_title), (nautilus_sidebar_title_size_allocate): Updated for
	name change.

2001-04-24  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fix bug where theme selector would not show themes when the theme
	directory is a symlink.
	
	* src/nautilus-theme-selector.c:
	(nautilus_theme_selector_destroy): Small code cleanup.
	(vfs_file_exists): Pass GNOME_VFS_FILE_INFO_FOLLOW_LINKS.
	(populate_list_with_themes_from_directory): Pass
	GNOME_VFS_FILE_INFO_FOLLOW_LINKS.

	More work on making components go away if Nautilus is prematurely
	terminated.

	* src/nautilus-window-toolbars.c:
	(nautilus_window_initialize_toolbars): Don't create a throbber for
	the desktop, since it doesn't get killed reliably since it never
	gets an X window.
	
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_destroy), (nautilus_window_allow_stop): Do some
	minor cleanup of throbber code.

	* nautilus-clean.sh: Add an option to just display the processes
	and not kill them. Useful for me when I'm writing code that's
	designed to make the processes go away. Also remove the gconfd
	saved state file if we kill gconfd (only nautilus-clean.sh -x) for
	maximum cleanliness (but also maximum unhappiness for any
	remaining gconf clients).

	Fixed bug 7650 (Display flashes forever when Text viewer
	used in FTP)

	* components/text/nautilus-text-view.c: (file_read_callback):
	Bail out when bytes_read is 0, instead of trying again forever.
	This happens at EOF.

2001-04-23  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c: (mark_new_items),

	(nautilus_first_time_druid_show):
	Remove extra argument to update_draw_desktop_checkbox_state()

	change and so the build broke.
	
2001-04-23  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Add a new command-line option "--no-desktop" as requested by
	fcrozat on behalf of people who want to run Nautilus under KDE as
	well as under GNOME. The option has no effect if Nautilus is
	already running, but if it's the first invocation of Nautilus,
	then no desktop-related preferences show up and the desktop is
	not shown regardless of the setting of those preferences.
	
	* src/nautilus-main.c: (main): Add the no-desktop option. Make the
	desktop-related preferences invisible if it's on, and pass it down
	to the NautilusApplication.

	* src/nautilus-application.h:
	* src/nautilus-application.c: (nautilus_application_startup):
	Don't start the desktop if no_desktop is passed in. Otherwise
	decide based on the preference.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-box.c:
	(preferences_box_find_row): Mark this private function static.
	(preferences_box_populate_pane): Get rid of code that would
	translate the pane_name twice.
	(nautilus_preferences_dialog_new): Simplified this code a bit.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences.c:

	(preferences_key_make_for_getter),
	(nautilus_preferences_visible_in_current_user_level),
	(nautilus_preferences_is_visible): Added new flag to make a
	preference invisible.

	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.h:
	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.c: (set_up_gmc_transition_page),
	(nautilus_first_time_druid_show): Removed code that used to make
	the druid default based on the desktop preference.

	Fixed the Tinderbox.

	Fixed bug 8024 (Default folder viewer chosen from "View As..."
	window is not reflected in Preferences dialog)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.h:
	Put iids for Icon and List view here since they must be accessed
	from multiple places now. Add NAUTILUS_DEFAULT_FOLDER_VIEWER_OTHER
	enum case. Add prototype for 
	nautilus_global_preferences_set_default_folder_viewer.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c:
	(get_default_folder_viewer_preference_from_iid): New helper function,
	returns appropriate NAUTILUS_DEFAULT_FOLDER_VIEWER preference value
	based on folder-viewing iid.
	(default_default_folder_viewer_callback): New function to determine
	default value of NAUTILUS_DEFAULT_FOLDER_VIEWER preference; uses
	gnome_vfs_mime (name is not a typo).
	(set_default_folder_viewer_in_gnome_vfs): New function,
	updates gnome-vfs mime database properly for new folder-viewing iid.
	(default_folder_viewer_changed_callback): New function, reacts
	to change in NAUTILUS_DEFAULT_FOLDER_VIEWER preference by updating
	gnome-vfs mime database (moved here from nautilus-application.c).
	(nautilus_global_preferences_set_default_folder_viewer): New public
	function to set the default folder viewer with an iid; handles setting
	both gnome-vfs and gconf's values.
	(nautilus_global_preferences_initialize): Add callback for when
	default folder viewer changes (moved here from nautilus-application.c).
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-chooser.c:
	(set_default_for_type): Special-case folder viewer to call
	nautilus_global_preferences_set_default_folder_viewer.
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml: Changed
	"Reset to View Preferences" to "Reset View to Match Preferences".

	when looking for the topmost window.

	* components/news/nautilus-news.c (set_up_edit_widgets): when

	(get_xalf_prefix): Placeholder for code to figure out the right
	set of parameters to pass to xalf.
