<b>The Nautilus Window</b><br><br>
Nautilus provides an easy way to view, manage, and customize your own files and
folders, as well as browse the Web and access LAN directories. Nautilus is the
window to your network user environment. It integrates your access to
files, applications, media, Internet-based resources, and the Web.

<td><b>Files, Folders, and Views</b><br><br>
The pop-up menu on the Location bar lists the available views. You can view
your files and folders as icons or as a list, and there are special views
available for specific file types. For instance, try View as Music for your
MP3 files.<br><br>
<li>In list view, click the column heads to re-order the items.<br><br>
<li>In icon view, open the Edit menu and choose Lay Out Items to see the
options for arranging the icons.<br><br>
<li>In any view, trying zooming in and out. Zooming in on text files reveals more of their contents.
Image files are represented as thumbnails, so you know at a glance which file contains which
image.<br><br>
<li>In icon view, you can enlarge (stretch) individual icons. For instance,
enlarge the icon for a folder you frequently need to find. Select the folder's
icon, open the Edit menu, choose Stretch Icon, and use the "handles" to stretch
the icon. (Left-click outside the icon when you're done stretching.)<br><br>
To duplicate, rename, or delete a file or folder, right-click to item and

option you want.

<td><b>Music Files and Folders</b><br><br>
If you have a lot of MP3 files, Nautilus offers some features designed
expressly for you. View as Music lets you organize your music files in a way
that's best suited for music, rather than making you try to adapt views
designed for text.<br><br>
To see the special features, go to one of your folders containing MP3 files.
Open the pop-up menu at the right of the Location bar, and choose View as
Music.<br><br>
The View as Music option presents your music folders as albums. You see a
listing of titles, artists, playing times, and bit rates. Use the player at the
bottom of the window to play your tunes, or simply mouse over a file to preview
it.<br><br>
The Set Cover Image button lets you choose a special icon for each of your
music folders.

<td align="center"><img src="figures/colors_small.png"></td>
<td><b>Customizing Backgrounds</b><br><br>
A drag-and-drop dialog box lets you apply patterned backgrounds, colors, and
emblems to objects in the Nautilus window. For instance, you can choose a
special background pattern for the sidebar to display each time you open a
particular folder.
<br><br>Open the Edit menu and choose Backgrounds and Colors,
click Backgrounds, Colors, or Emblems, and drag and drop to create the look
you want.
<br><br>For example, to customize the sidebar view of a particular folder,
drag a background or color tile to the sidebar while the folder's icon is
displayed there.

<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="figures/emblems_small.png"></td>
<td><b>Customizing icons</b><br><br>
There are several ways to customize icons:<br><br>
<li>Attach emblems to files and folder simply by
dragging them. Open the Edit menu, choose Backgrounds and Emblems, click
Emblems, and then drag an emblem to an icon.<br><br>
 <li>Right-click a file or folder to see its Properties dialog. The
Properties dialog lets you choose emblems, apply a custom icon, change the
file or folder name, and edit permissions.<br><br>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Icon Captions. The Icon Captions dialog box
lets you specify three lines of information that will appear in all icon
captions in addition to the file or folder name.<br><br>
<li>To give a file or folder a custom icon, select the item so it is displayed in the sidebar. Then drag any
image to the item in the sidebar. For instance, if you have a folder containing
MP3 versions of Beatles music, you replace the folder's generic folder icon
with a picture of the Beatles.<br><br>
