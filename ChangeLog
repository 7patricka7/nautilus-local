2000-04-29  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@redhat.com>

	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add $(BONOBO_CFLAGS)
	so that we can pick up the path to the bonobo includes in case
	they are built somewhere else than the standard location.

2000-04-29  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* configure.in:
	* librsvg/Makefile.am:
	Check in patch suggested by Roberto Zunino
	<zunino@cli.di.unipi.it>.  Check for gdk-pixbuf in configure and
	use the flags set by that in the rsvg makefile.
	
2000-04-28  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-text-item.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-text-item.h
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager-private.h
	Fixed the following FIXME bugs: 684 686 687
	Hooked up the undo mechanism to work properly with
	the renaming widget.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager.h
	Add configuration defaults to sets the UndoManager to 
	not use the redo functionality and sets the depth of
	the undo list to one transaction.
	(nautilus_undo_manager_enable_redo):
	Function to toggle on or off the ability to redo undone transactions.
	(nautilus_undo_manager_set_queue_depth):
	Function to set the max depth of the undo/redo queues
	(free_undo_manager_list_data):
	New utility function to clean up data in undo/redo list
	(prune_undo_manager_list):
	New utility function that prunes a set number of items from
	either the undo or redo list.
	(nautilus_undo_manager_add_undo_transaction):
	Manually insert an externally created undo transaction into
	the undo queue.
	(nautilus_undo_manager_add_redo_transaction):
	Manually insert an externally created undo transaction into
	the redo queue.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-transaction.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-transaction.h
	(nautilus_undo_transaction_destroy):
	Added destructor function for a NautilusUndoTransaction object

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c

	Fixed bug 755.  Connected to signal sent by undo manager that informs
	Undo menu item sensitivity to be set.
	
2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-background.c
	(background_destroyed_callback),
	(nautilus_connect_background_to_directory):
	gtk_signal_connect_while_alive wasn't quite up to the task,
	so I had to redo the fix from my last check-in.

2000-04-28  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am:
	Add missing .h files to SOURCES.
	
2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-background.c
	(nautilus_connect_background_to_directory): 
	Added code to disconnect when the background is destroyed.
	This was exposed by our lack of leaking now!
	
2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* ntl-window-msgs.c (nautilus_window_has_really_changed):
	Quick, kinda-hacky fix for the bug you'd see when you
	switch to "hardware:" and then do go-back.

2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (async_get_file_info_text):
	Fix bug that prevents non-vfs URIs from working.
	Just need to initialize the async. handle to NULL.

2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	This little check-in fixes the last April bug and maybe one or
	two leaks in Nautilus.

	* src/ntl-view.c (nautilus_view_destroy_client): To work around
	the circular reference problem in Bonobo, change a call to
	bonobo_object_unref to bonobo_object_destroy. This fixes the leak
	of the entire viewer each time.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (fm_directory_view_destroy):
	The FMDirectoryView does not own its view_frame. This is confusing
	and needs some reorganization, but it should not unref. It's actually
	the view_frame that owns the directory view despite the fact that
	it's created by the directory view and the directory view holds a
	reference to it! This bug prevented Maciej from doing the workaround
	the last time he tried it.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-changes-queue.c
	(nautilus_file_changes_queue_get),
	(nautilus_file_changes_consume_changes):
	A small cleanup. The global variable was getting in the way.
	
2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-main.c (main): Fix a dumbass mistake.  Take out some
	real code from inside an assert.
	
2000-04-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Some cleanup inspired by Maciej's check-in.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c
	(ready_callback_call),
	(nautilus_directory_call_when_ready_internal),
	(call_ready_callbacks):
	Made the fix so that call_when_ready works properly when a NULL
	directory is passed in.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c
	(nautilus_file_call_when_ready): Fix for call_when_ready with
	a NULL file.
	(nautilus_file_ref), (nautilus_file_list_ref),
	(nautilus_file_list_copy): Filled out the operations on lists.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c
	(nautilus_gtk_object_list_ref), (nautilus_gtk_object_list_copy):
	Filled out the operations on lists.
	
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (got_metadata_callback): Factored out the
	call to async get_file_info to simplify the logic.
	(nautilus_navigation_info_new): Took out the check for NULL that
	Maciej mentioned in his notes below now that call_when_ready can
	handle things.
	(nautilus_navigation_info_cancel),
	(nautilus_navigation_info_free): Took out some excessive NULL
	checks when calling routines that work with NULL.

2000-04-28  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-content-view.c (nautilus_content_view_set_active): Fix a
	refcounting problem; make sure to unref the interface we
	query_local_interface for.

	* components/music/nautilus-music-view.oafinfo: Add "audio/x-mp3"
	as directory content type that satisfies the requirement so the
	music view activates automatically (the point of the below
	excercise). Netscape thinks the mime type for mp3's should be
	"audio/x-mpeg" but I am not going to argue.

	Achieved bugzilla tasks #701 and #108, plus did some refactoring
	of the big hairy `got_file_info_callback' function.

	* src/ntl-uri-map.h: add a `files' member to the
	NautilusNavigationInfo struct, a GList of NautilusFiles it
	contains in case it is a directory.
	
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (got_file_info_callback): Factored out some
	code into separate functions and simplified the control flow. For
	each potential component, test if it matches the content
	requirements before adding it to the list of available content
	view components.

	(make_oaf_query_with_known_mime_type,
	make_oaf_query_with_uri_scheme_only): New function; breaks out the
	logic of constructing an oaf query when the mime type is known and
	unknown repsectively from `got_file_info_callback'.
	(make_oaf_query_with_known_mime_type): Remove the hack to try to
	explicitly exclude the music view.

	(file_list_to_mime_type_hash_table): New utility function; takes a
	GList of NautilusFiles and returns a hash table which has an entry
	for each mime type that at least one of thse files has. This is so
	that we can susequently test if any of the files on the list has a
	particular mime type in constant time.
	(server_matches_content_requirements): New fucntion. Returns true
	if the server record does not require specific content mime types,
	or if it does and the passed hash table contains at least one of
	those.

	(nautilus_view_identifier_new_from_oaf_server_info): New helper
	function to create a NautilusViewIdentifier directly from an
	OAF_ServerInfo record.

	(got_metadata_callback): Initialize the `files' field of the
	navinfo struct to a copy of the file list that
	`nautilus_directory_call_when_ready' gave us; ref all the
	NautilusFiles in this copy.
	(nautilus_navigation_info_new): Ask for the mime types of files in
	the directory as well as for the metadata keys we need.
	(nautilus_navigation_info_cancel): Only try to cancel if the
	navinfo actually has a directory, to avoid segfaulting.
	(nautilus_navigation_info_free): Free the files list. Free both
	this and the directory if and only if they are not NULL.

	
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (nautilus_navigation_info_new): When
	navinfo->directory is null, call got_metadata_callback directly
	instead of calling `nautilus_directory_call_when_ready' to avoid
	segfaulting on protocols that gnome-vfs does not understand like
	`hardware:'. There is probably a way to fix this in
	`nautilus_directory_call_when_ready' but I did not want to mess
	with it.
	(got_file_info_callback): Renamed from `my_notify_when_ready'.

2000-04-27  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c: include
	<stdlib.h>, my compiler insists on it.

2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Add a real check for pam.

	* acconfig.h:
	Add HAVE_PAM.
	
	* configure.in:
	Check for pam.
	
	* helper-utilities/authenticate/Makefile.am:
	Use $(PAM_LIBS) instead of hardcoding.

2000-04-27  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 660 (Need to publish menu positions for components to use)

	* libnautilus/nautilus-bonobo-ui.h:
	New file, contains #defines for Bonobo-style menu paths for all
	the menus & menu items in Nautilus that we promise components
	will exist.
	* libnautilus/Makefile.am: Include this new header file in library.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: Extensive changes, too many to list
	every function. Replaced all the GnomeUIInfo mechanism with
	Bonobo-style menu creation, using the menu paths from
	nautilus-bonobo-ui.h. While I was in here, I also renamed some
	functions (especially xxx_cb -> xxx_callback), tweaked some text, 
	and used some more standard Gnome menu item pixmaps (not sure if I 
	like them or not yet).
	
	* src/ntl-window-private.h,
	* src/ntl-window.c:
	(nautilus_window_back_cb), (nautilus_window_forward_cb),
	(nautilus_window_up_cb), (nautilus_window_home_cb): Replaced
	these GtkWidget-callback style functions (formerly used
	by both menu items and toolbar buttons) with new NautilusWindow
	oriented ones nautilus_window_go_back, nautilus_window_go_forward,
	nautilus_window_go_up, and nautilus_window_go_home.
	(nautilus_window_allow_back), (nautilus_window_allow_forward),
	(nautilus_window_allow_up): replaced hardwired Bonobo menu paths
	with the new #defines.

	* src/nautilus-window-toolbars.c:
	Renamed some functions xxx_cb -> xxx_callback.
	(toolbar_back_callback), (toolbar_forward_callback),
	(toolbar_up_callback), (toolbar_home_callback): New GtkWidget-callback
	style functions used exclusively by the toolbar.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	Removed FM_DIRECTORY_VIEW_PATH_CLOSE and 
	FM_DIRECTORY_VIEW_PATH_SELECT_ALL, since callers should use
	the paths defined by Nautilus for these.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus): Replaced special insider knowledge
	of menu positions with use of the new #defines. Also tweaked with the
	keyboard underscore shortcuts for some items.

2000-04-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	Rewrite of the state machine. This adds the new feature that Maciej
	needs where you can call "call_when_ready" to get file attributes.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h:
	Added a file_list_monitored boolean to simplify the logic.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c
	(nautilus_directory_destroy): Took advantage of file_list_monitored
	simplification.
	(nautilus_directory_call_when_ready),
	(nautilus_directory_cancel_callback): Tweaked the return_if_fail
	calls to match changes in the async.c file.
	(got_files_callback), (nautilus_self_check_directory):
	Added self-check code to test the new feature.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c (nautilus_str_compare):
	Added a new function for use with things that take a GCompareFunc
	to avoid a function type cast.

2000-04-27  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undoable.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undoable.h
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager.h
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-transaction.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-transaction.h
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-manager-private.h
	Added architecture for undo mechanism.
	NautilusUndoManager maintains undo and redo queues of
	NautilusUndoTransactions as well as maintaining various state
	information pertinant to the user interface.
	NautilusUndoTransaction contains a transaction name and a list of
	NautilusUndoables. NautilusUndoable is a object that contains a
	pointer to an object and a GData object. The GData object
	contains named data that can be added and retrieved during an
	undo/ redo operation. The NautilusUndoable also emits signals to
	the object that enables it to perform the undo and redo
	operations. I will write up more complete documents when the code
	has matured.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.h
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c
	Removed obsolete undo functions and callbacks. These were
	invalidated by the new undo mechanism.

	* src/ntl-main.c
	Added call to nautilus_undo_manager_initialize_global_manager() in
	main. This call initializes a Nautilus global undo manager. Also
	fixed some minor coding style issues.
	
	* nautilus-window-menus.c (edit_menu_undo_callback):
	Added callback to handle selection of Undo item form edit menu.
	Callback checks with Undo Manager for a current undo transaction
	and asks manager to perform an undo if there is one.

2000-04-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* MAINTAINERS: Changed to the new Nautilus list instead of the
	old secret list.
	
	* components/notes/ntl-notes.c (notes_load_metainfo):
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c
	(fm_directory_view_load_uri), (metadata_ready_callback):
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (got_metadata_callback),
	(nautilus_navigation_info_new):
	Change calls to use new API, but not to use any of the new features,
	which are not yet implemented.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:
	Added the new API and moved functions around a bit to prepare
	for the new feature needed by Maciej for getting a list of files.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-attributes.h:
	Added an attribute constant for MIME type.
	
2000-04-27  J. Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>
	
	* components/services/install/genpkg_list.example
	* components/services/install/eazel-install.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-protocols.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-types.h
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-xml-package-list.h
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-xml-package-list.c

	Cleaned up invalid variable names to conform to eazel coding standards.
	Added the genpkg_list option to create a package-list.xml from a
	colon delimited input file.  Created an example file of the input
	called genpkg_list.example.

2000-04-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	More FIXME-to-bug work.
	
	* check-FIXME.pl: Fixed bug that happens when there are no
	outstanding FIXMEs (hooray!).
	
	* components/hardware/nautilus-hardware-view.c

	Added bug numbers to FIXMEs, writing bug reports as needed.

2000-04-27  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	More FIXME-to-bug work.
	
	* configure.in
	* components/services/startup/nautilus-service-startup-view.c,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.c,
	* src/ntl-uri-map.c:

	Wrote bug reports for all FIXMEs in these files. With
	this checkin and Darin's next one, there should be no
	more FIXMEs in Nautilus without a bug report. 

2000-04-27  Joe Shaw <joe@helixcode.com>

        * components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c
        (nautilus_rpm_view_update_from_uri): Changed call of fdValidb
        to checking to ensure that file_descriptor != NULL. fdValid was
        removed from RPM 3.0.4 and this bit of code provides the same
        functionality. It'll build on 3.0.4-based systems now (like Red   
        Hat 6.2). Bad Red Hat for breaking reverse compatibility on a
        minor upgrade.

2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (my_notify_when_ready): Quiet down the mjs
	debug noise for us mortals.
	
2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Add authenticate helper utility to build.

	* Makefile.am:
	Add helper-utilities to build.

	* configure.in:
	Add helper-utilities and helper-utilities/authenticate to build
	using a conditional flag until better pam detection voodoo can be
	written.

	* helper-utilities: New dir.

	* helper-utilities/authenticate: New dir.  A simple utility to
	authenticate a user using PAM and execute a command on their
	behalf.  Still needs some work to be more useful.

	* helper-utilities/authenticate/nautilus-authenticate.h,
	  helper-utilities/authenticate/nautilus-authenticate.c,
	  helper-utilities/authenticate/nautilus-authenticate-pam.c,
	  helper-utilities/authenticate/nautilus-authenticate-fork.c:
	New files.  Code for authenticate helper utility.
	
2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	More 'make dist' fixes.  I missed the services dir.

	* components/services/install/Makefile.am:
	  Add missing .h files SOURCES.

	* components/services/startup/Makefile.am:
	  Add missing .h files SOURCES.

	* Makefile.am:
	Add nautilus.png to EXTRA_DIST.

2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Add gnome panel .desktop file and logo.

	* nautilus.desktop: New panel .desktop file.
	* nautilus.png: New panel nautilus icon.
	* Makefile.am: Install the above 2.  Also install the
	  nautilus-clean.sh script.
	
	* src/run-nautilus: Add dumb script to run nautilus while we work
	  on the rogue process bugs.

	* src/Makefile.am: Install the above script.
	
2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	More 'make dist' fixes.  Let automake know about private headers
	so that the dist tarball will contain them.

	* components/help/Makefile.am,
	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am,
	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am,
	* components/sample/Makefile.am:
	Add .h files to SOURCES.

	* libnautilus/Makefile.am:
	Add missing nautilus-zoomable.h to HEADERS.
	Add missing private .h files SOURCES.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am:
	Add missing .h files to HEADERS.
	Add missing private .h files SOURCES.
	Add missing idl sources top EXTRA_DIST.
	
	* nautilus-widgets/Makefile.am:
	Add missing nautilus-widgets-self-check-functions.h to SOURCES.
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	Add missing nautilus.h to SOURCES.
	
2000-04-27  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* librsvg/Makefile.am:
	Add .h files to la_SOURCES to make 'make dist' happy.
	
2000-04-27  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Fix bugzilla task #106:

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (mime_type_get_supertype,
	uri_string_get_scheme): Helper functions for generating the
	OAF queries.
	(my_notify_when_ready): Replaced the hardcoded mess with calls to
	a couple of OAF queries. This function still needs major
	additional refactoring. I have also introduced some FIXMEs which
	call attention to problems that were already there in the code in
	most cases.

	* components/hardware/nautilus-hardware-view.oafinfo,
	components/help/hyperbola.oafinfo,
	components/html/ntl-web-browser.oafinfo,
	components/mozilla/nautilus-mozilla-content-view.oafinfo,

	components/websearch/ntl-web-search.oafinfo, src/nautilus.oafinfo:
	Added all relevant general, bonobo and nautilus properties to
	content views; some to meta views.	

2000-04-26  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>
	
	added an "About Nautilus" HTML file to the novice home directory
	
	* data/top/About.html: new about file

2000-04-26  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug #683, experts shouldn't get suffix stripped from link file
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.h:
	added preference for show_real_file_names
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c:
	made the user level code set show_real_file_names appropriately

	(make_uri_canonical), (is_canonical_uri),
	(nautilus_directory_get), (get_parent_directory_if_exists),

	Fixed bug #99:  Implemented copy, paste, clear, and cut for text
	Added new files nautilus-clipboard.c,h which contains clipboard
	functionality.  All components with text widgets should use this
	code.  It can just be copied from any existing sample code
	(see ntl-notes.c in the notes component)
	The frame cut, copy and paste stuff is now happy when there is a

	Removing current installer in order to checkin the new structure

2000-04-25  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Simplified preferences api by letting gconf do most of the work.
	Removed usage of global preferences from everywhere.  There is no
	longer a global preferences object.  All preference peek/poke
	operations are done through a gconf client thing.

	* components/history/ntl-history-view.c:
	(main): Call nautilus_preferences_initialize()

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c:
	Removed usage of global preferences.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	Remove usage of unneeded global preferences.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c
	Remove usage of unneeded global preferences.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-list.c:
	Remove usage of unneeded global preferences.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preference.c
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preference.h:
	Remove all default_value related crap.  Not needed no more.  Let
	gconf worry about default values.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-group.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-group.h:
	(nautilus_preferences_group_add_item): 
	No longer need to pass in preferences.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-item.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-item.h:
	No longer need to store a reference to a preferences object in our
	class.  Also,  no longer need to pass in preferences to any
	function.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-pane.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-pane.h:
	(nautilus_preferences_pane_add_item_to_nth_group): No longer need
	to pass in preferences.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.h:
	Remove the NautilusPreferences class.  Gconf does the thinking for
	preferences now and there is no need to divide things up by
	domain - thus no need for multiple preference objects.  The api
	was changed to reflect this.  All preferences peek/poke operations
	go through a global gconf_client thing.

	Removed the storing and usage of a value.  Gconf and only it
	stores values for preferences.

	Use gconf for callback notifications.

	* nautilus-widgets/test-nautilus-widgets.c: Update for the above
	changes.
	
	2000-04-25  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c:

	(somewhere else) show up.

	* src/ntl-window-state.c:

2000-04-25  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* HACKING: Updated URL for popt.
	
	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:
	(nautilus_rpm_view_update_from_uri):
	Changed to use FD_t for real instead of casting a pointer to a
	raw file descriptor to it.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	Told it to load 32 items at a time instead of 1.
	I think it's time we try this. It seems to work.

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (my_notify_when_ready),
	(got_metadata_callback): Change to use the new version of
	async. get_file_info.

2000-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	made drag and drop to and from the location bar work properly
	
	* src/nautilus-location-bar.c:
	changed the exported drag action to GDK_ACTION_LINK, as well as making
	it accept links.  Fixed crashes in drag_data_get by referencing the
	actual location bar instead of the event box, and by not destroying
	the result from gtk_entry_get_text, since it's not a copy.  Made it
	actually go to the dropped in uri by emitting the location changed
	signal.

2000-04-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* data/mime/nautilus.keys
	
	Removed [en_US] from file-type human-readable descriptions.

2000-04-25  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug 519: dead space in sidebar
	
	* src/ntl-index-panel.c:
	removed set_usize call that was setting the meta-views to a fixed size;
	instead, set the expand and fill parameters to the box pack call to
	true, so the metaview is sized to fill the available space
	
	fixed bug 362: tab color is settable but not remembered
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-metadata.h:

	Adding http fetch of remote rpm files.  Minor cleanups.  Adding credit
	to Joe Shaw <joe@helixcode.com> for portions of the current prototype.
	This should have been done at the very beginning.  The idea for using
	gnet and large chunks of the current xml parsing come from his work on
	the Helix Code install/updater.

2000-04-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed part of bug 556 (nautilus_file_can_rename returns
	TRUE for /root, but shouldn't). Only remaining issue is
	the no-nautilus-file-for-/ problem, which is already written
	up separately.
	
	Fixed bug 546 (Folders/files without read permissions should
	not be viewable).
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_denies_access_permission): New private
	function that checks permissions, including checking
	whether the current user is the owner or in the group
	of the queried file. If permissions aren't valid, returns
	FALSE.
	(nautilus_file_can_read), (nautilus_file_can_write),
	(nautilus_file_can_execute): New public functions that
	use nautilus_file_denies_access_permission to determine
	which access permissions the current user has. They return
	TRUE if permissions aren't valid, so callers still have to
	be prepared to handle failures.
	(nautilus_file_can_rename): Now calls nautilus_file_can_write
	on the parent directory. Formerly it was just checking the
	permission flags directly, ignoring whether the current user
	was the owner or not. This fixes part of bug 556.
	
	* src/ntl-window-msgs.c:
	(handle_unreadable_location): New private function, puts up
	an alert if the user tries to switch to an unreadable location.
	(nautilus_window_request_location_change): Try 
	handle_unreadable_location before starting up the state transition.
	This fixes bug 546.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-error-reporting.c:

2000-04-24  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	changed the location of the novice home directory, and gave it
	a custom icon

	renamed routines from "top" to "main", and changed the install location
	from ~/.nautilus/top to ~/Nautilus, and set a custom icon for it

	(nautilus_user_top_directory): Formatting tweak.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c
	(nautilus_pop_up_context_menu): Got rid of gpointer cast, since
	George's "find bad casts" grep found it and it's not needed.
	
	* nautilus-widgets/test-preferences.c: Got rid of gpointer cast,
	since George's "find bad casts" grep found it and it's not needed.

2000-04-24  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/install/Makefile.am:
	Fixed a few things in these make files. There's still a lot to be fixed.
	The most important fix was to add OAF_CFLAGS and OAF_LIBS. Without that
	the build was failing. But these files still have a hard-coded
	/usr/include path for librpm.

2000-04-24  J. Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	services library down the road.

2000-04-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* configure.in: Check for -lrpm and its dependency libs.

	Added BUILD_RPMVIEW_COMPONENT automake conditional.
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_RPM): Added.

	* components/Makefile.am: Conditionally compile rpmview.

	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am: Use $(RPM_LIBS) rather than
	-lrpm so we get the correct dependency libs such as -lgz2.

2000-04-22  J. Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/libnautilus-extensions.h
	Fixing build bustage in components/help.  The header was pointing to
	files in libnautilus instead of libnautilus-extensions.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.h

	Call nautilus_preferences_init to make sure gconf is in business
	before we call it.

2000-04-21  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Switched us to use gconf instead of gnome_config.  There is still
	lots of crufty preferences code that can be simplified a lot,

	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.h:
	Straight forward switch from gnome_config api to gconf api.
	(gnome_config_make_string):  Retired, cause thankfully we dont
	need to make up dumb strings with a default value appened to the
	end. All praise gconf.
	(nautilus_preferences_init): Add a init function to make sure
	gconf is properly initialized.  This needs some cleanup wrt the
	global preferences crap.  Im planning to clean that up in my next
	checkin.

	* nautilus-widgets/test-nautilus-widgets.c:
	Fixed for gconf changes.

	* src/ntl-main.c:
	Call nautilus_preferences_init to make sure gconf is in business

	more.
	
2000-04-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/history/ntl-history-view.c
	(hyperbola_navigation_history_notify_location_change):

	(nautilus_music_view_initialize_class),
	(nautilus_music_view_initialize), (setup_title_font),

	(nautilus_icon_container_remove),
	(nautilus_icon_container_set_auto_layout):
	Some tweaks for auto-layout mode. Made it work better with
	stretching by not laying out the currently-stretched icon,
	simplified the code a bit, and made it relayout when an icon
	is removed.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (compute_menu_item_info),
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus):
	Got rid of the "..." from "Delete...". On Macintosh, at least,
	the "..." is only used when the dialog is something that adds
	parameters to the command, not when it's just a confirmation.

	Darin helped me finish implementing the missing parts of the call,
	including updating the reference to the new directory object,
	updating the file info structure to match the file's new location.
	Fixed a silly bug in an if statement.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-changes-queue.c:
	Fixed another silly bug where 'file moved' notifications were
	misinterpreted as file-removed ones.

2000-04-19  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(nautilus_directory_notify_files_added):
	Work on making new files show up during copy. This is a simple
	version using sync gnome_vfs_get_file_info calls, we'll need a
	version that uses a new async get_file_info call that takes a list
	of URIs and produces a list of file info structs.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:
	(update_file_info_in_list_if_needed), (dequeue_pending_idle_callback),
	(nautilus_file_update):
	Made dequeue_pending_idle_callback deal with getting duplicate
	file info structures or file info structures for files we already
	know about. This also fixes 395.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-changes-queue.c
	Added some better comments and removed a fixme that didn't really
	need fixing.

2000-04-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Darin and I started out thinking we were going to start entering
	bugs for the FIXME items but we were distracted into fixing bugs
	and tweaking code that we found while doing so.
	
	* check-FIXME.pl: Won't search old ChangeLogs for FIXMEs either;
	changed FIXME format from "FIXME bug xxx" to "FIXME bugzilla.eazel.com xxx"
	
	* components/history/ntl-history-view.c:
	(hyperbola_navigation_history_notify_location_change): Moved bookmark
	naming hack here and added FIXME explaining it.

	(nautilus_bookmark_new), (nautilus_bookmark_new_with_name):
	Combined these two into one routine that takes both the uri and
	title; removed hack for trying to come up with good name for
	bookmark here.
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_pixmap_and_mask): Changed to call
	_get_pixbuf instead of duplicating code.
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_pixbuf): Changed interface to return
	pixbuf or NULL instead of boolean result & "out" parameter.
	
	* src/nautilus-bookmark-list.c,
	* src/nautilus-bookmarks-window.c,
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c,
	* src/ntl-window-msgs.c: 
	Updated callers of nautilus_bookmark_new and _new_with_name.

	Fixed bug 540 (need specific error message for "access denied"
	when renaming)

	* src/file-manager/fm-error-reporting.c:
	(fm_report_error_renaming_file): Added case for
	GNOME_VFS_ERROR_ACCESSDENIED

2000-04-19  Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>
	
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-lib-rpm.c
	Fixed Uninstall to work as advertised.  Uninstall will also skip
	source packages now since they are not stored in the rpmdb.

2000-04-19  Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>
	
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-lib-xml.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-lib-debug.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-lib-rpm.c
	* components/services/install/eazel-install-lib.h
	* components/services/install/eazel-install.c
	Tweaked the packages struct so that rpm names are no longer
	hardcoded.  Added a the option to do dry runs without actually
	installing anything.  Good for testing.

2000-04-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	(world_width_changed): New function, extracted from size_allocate.
	(size_allocate): Call world-width-changed.
	(nautilus_icon_container_set_zoom_level): Call world_width_changed.
	This makes zooming relayout when in auto-layout mode.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(append_bookmark_to_menu): Added line where bookmark is set in
	BookmarkHolder. This had been accidentally deleted, breaking all
	bookmarks.

2000-04-19  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added Danish language

2000-04-19  Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	A directory called /etc/eazel/services will be created to store
	cofiguration options and uninstall data now.

2000-04-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-view.c (nautilus_view_destroy_client): Reverted the last
	change, it caused serious crashage in some cases.

	* src/ntl-view.c (nautilus_view_destroy_client): Destroy the
	ViewFrame instead of unreffing. This is the only way to be sure
	the Control is fully unref()d. Ideally Bonobo would let us unbind
	the frame from the control to break the circular refs.
	
	* configure.in: Check for OAF the oficially approved way. Check
	for GConf.

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (my_notify_when_ready): Fix fallback_iid for
	moz protocol.
	* components/mozilla/main.c (main): Remove ev variable to shut up gcc.
	
	* src/ntl-app.c, components/notes/ntl-notes.c: Remove some
	spurious debugging statements I accidentally left in.
	

	OAF conversion. You must now build bonobo and gnome-vfs with --enable-oaf

	* configure.in: Check for OAF

	* libnautilus/nautilus-view-component.idl: Inherit from
	Bonobo::Unknown instead of GNOME::Unknown.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c,
	libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.h: Refer to
	meta views by OAFIID, not GOAD ID.

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c (my_notify_when_ready): Replaced hardcoded
	list of GOAD IDs with a hardcoded list of OAFIIDs.
	(add_components_from_metadata): Changed the expected format; it is
	now label=component instead of component:label since OAFIIDs
	contain colons.

	* src/ntl-view.c (nautilus_view_destroy_client): unref the
	Zoomable interface of the View, if any.

	* src/file-manager/dfos-corba.c, src/file-manager/dfos.c: replace
	GOAD calls with OAF ones; untested since this code is not really
	used right now.

	* src/ntl-main.c: Use OAF calls to intialize CORBA.

	* src/ntl-app.c: Replace GOAD IDs with OAFIIDs. Use
	Bonobo_Generic_Factory instead of GNOME_Generic_Factory to make
	the linker happy. Register the factory server with OAF, not GOAD.

	* src/nautilus.h: Include <liboaf/liboaf.h> instead of <libgnorba/gnorba.h>

	*  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.c:
	(nautilus_preferences_get):  If the stored default value is null,

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.h:
	Renamed several public functions to use proper nomenclature.
	An example would be changing nautilus_icon_canvas_get_editable_text_bounds
	to nautilus_icon_canvas_item_get_editable_text_bounds. A few of 
	these misnaming were in my last submission.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:

2000-04-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Yet more tweakery to the file-monitoring code.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(stop_monitoring_files): Renamed to stop_monitoring_file_list.

	(nautilus_directory_file_monitor_remove_internal),
	(nautilus_directory_notify_files_added): Deployed
	new is_file_list_monitored function in three places.
	Two of these were bugs, one was code duplication.

2000-04-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 494 (initial directory count never appears in sidebar).

	This was a missing pieces of the async framework. Darin helped
	me finish it up.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h:
	Put FileMonitor struct here so NautilusFile can use it.
	(nautilus_directory_file_monitor_add_internal),
	(nautilus_directory_file_monitor_remove_internal),
	(remove_file_monitor_link): New functions, shared between
	NautilusDirectory and NautilusFile.

	(nautilus_index_title_set_uri): Move the item-count-monitoring
	code inside the file != NULL check so it doesn't fail at the
	root (where, due to a bug, file is NULL).

2000-04-18  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug where you'd see the name twice under each icon.
	Did some work for the new notify hooks that Pavel made.
	I'll finish those hooks soon.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-text-window.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-text-window.c:

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_initialize),
	(fm_icon_view_get_icon_text_attribute_names),
	(text_attribute_names_changed_callback):
	Moved attribute names default into FMIconTextWindow and made

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(is_canonical_uri): Added a function for use in asserts.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:

	track of click policy changes.

	(destroy): Unregister click_policy_changed callback on destroy.

	(nautilus_icon_container_initialize): Initialize the
	single_click_mode from preferences and register callback to keep
	track of changes in click policy.

	(click_policy_changed_callback): New preferences callback to keep
	track of click policy changes.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences.h: Dont expose the
	preference/enum info structure.  Remove these and use the
	NautilusPreference object instead to describe preferences.

	Add usage of default values to get_* api.  So now callers can
	provide a default which will be given back to them if no default
	exists.  For example, no default will exist for the preference
	when it was implicitly pulled out of someone's 	ass.

	The callback function no longer passes along the value.  Instead
	the caller is expected to use the get_ functions.

	Rename nautilus_preferences_{get,set}_string() to
	nautilus_preferences_{get,set}.  This matches the
	NautilusDirectory metadata api which uses strings for metadata by
	default.

	Also constify the get functions.
	
	(nautilus_preferneces_get_info): Renamed to 
	nautilus_preferneces_get_preference which returns a referenced
	pointer to the preference description object.  Perhaps this could
	have a better name.

	(nautilus_preferences_enum_add_entry): New function to add entries
	to enumerated preferences.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-group.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-group.h:
	(nautilus_preferences_group_add): Retire.

	(nautilus_preferences_group_add_item): New function that does all
	the work of creating an item based on a given item_type.

	* nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-item.c,
	  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-item.h: Use
	NautilusPreferences directly instead of GtkObject.

	Ref/unref the preference object properly.

	Use more consistent identifiers.  Fix some stupid style things.

	Update for NautilusPreference usage instead of the info struct
	hack). 

	*  nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-pane.c,
	   nautilus-widgets/nautilus-preferences-pane.h:
	(nautilus_preferences_pane_add_item_to_nth_group) : New function

	CLICK_ACTIVATION_TYPE preferences.  Add HOME_URI preference.  Add
	SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES preference.

	Make all the user level stuff private.  Dont expose either the
	user level preference or the user level values at all.  Instead,
	track user level changes in a callback and set corresponsing
	preferences accordingly.

	(nautilus_global_preferences_startup): Hook to make the above work
	properly.
	
	Cleanup the creation of the preferences dialog.


	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	(icon_theme_changed_callback): Preference changed callback no
	longer passes in the value.  Value needs to be manually fetched.

	(nautilus_get_current_icon_factory): No need to call
	nautilus_preferences_set_info.  Instead give
	nautilus_preferences_get a default value.  This way, we can always
	get something reasonable back.


	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(use_eazel_theme_icons_cb): Update for pref api changes.  Feed the
	get function a default value.

	* src/ntl-app.c:
	(nautilus_app_class_init): Call
	nautilus_global_preferences_startup so that user level callbacks
	always works.  Also, allows preferences exposed in the ui to have
	nice defaults.
	
	* src/ntl-main.c:
	(main): Add nautilus-widgets self checks.

	* src/ntl-uri-map.c:
	(add_meta_view_iids_from_preferences): Feed the pref api function
	a default value. 

	* src/ntl-window-state.c:
	(nautilus_window_set_initial_state): User level is no longer

	fetching the HOME_URI preference.

	(use_new_window_changed_callback): Retired.  Instead check
	preference when needed.  There really is not need to go to the
	trouble of installing a callback for this specific preference.
	Its just as easy (and not a performance issues) to check it
	directly.  

	Also retired the 'use_new_window' member.

	(user_level_changed_callback): Retired.  User level no longer
	publically exposed.

	(show_hidden_files_changed_callback):  Check SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES
	preference to determine if hidden files should be filtered.

	Add a 'show_hidden_files' member that keeps track of changes in
	this preference.

	(fm_directory_view_initialize): Initialize 'show_hidden_files'.
	Update for callback name change.

	(nautilus_preferences_remove_callback): Remove uneeded unregister
	call for retired use_new_window callback.

	(queue_pending_files): Do hidden file filtering based on
	'show_hidden_files' instead of using the user level.

	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): Check USE_NEW_WINDOW preference
	to determine if a new window is requested.

	*  src/file-manager/fm-icon-text-window.c: #include fm-icon-virw.h
	and use DEFAULT_ICON_VIEW_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE_NAMES from it instead of
	ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_DEFAULT.  This makes sure the default is not out
	of whack.  This define should probably be placed in a better place.

	NOTE: This seems to be one of the drawbacks of passing in defaults
	to fetch functions - that is out-of-whackness in 2 or more callers
	in difference places.
	
	(synch_menus_with_preference),
	(changed_attributes_option_menu_cb): Update for preference api changes.
	
	(preference_changed_callback): Rename to
	icon_view_text_attribute_changed_callback for clarity.

	(icon_view_text_attribute_changed_callback): Value no longer
	passed into callback.  Need to check preferences manually.  
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.h:
	Add DEFAULT_ICON_VIEW_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE_NAMES to share with
	fm-icon-text-window.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(fm_icon_view_icon_text_changed_callback): Update for preference
	api changes.

	Minor anal style formatting of the private prototypes.

	(fm_icon_view_initialize_class): Yank
	nautilus_preferences_set_info call.  No longer needed for there to
	be proper defaults.  

	(text_attribute_names_changed_callback): Value no longer
	passed into callback.  Need to check preferences manually.  Also,
	feed the get function a reasonable default.

	* components/help/Makefile.am: Needs to link with
	libnautilus-extensions. 
	
	* components/websearch/Makefile.am: Needs to link with

	and produces change entries stuffing them into the file changes
	queue.

	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c:
	(handle_xfer_ok):
	Added calls to the new nautilus_file_changes_consume_changes
	from the progress update callback. This callback is called in

	them is not yet implemented.

	Did some cleanup on the new renaming code.

	* nautilus-glib-extensions.c:
	* nautilus-glib-extensions.h:
	Added nautilus_g_list_exactly_one_item and

	unless the renaming state has actually changed.
	
	* nautilus-icon-canvas-item.h: Fixed formatting.

	* nautilus-icon-container.c:
	* nautilus-icon-container.h:
	Added nautilus_icon_container_set_auto_layout and
	nautilus_icon_container_is_auto_layout. For now they are
	placeholders that just modify a boolean.

	metadata.
	(fm_icon_view_get_icon_text_attribute_names): Changed to get rid
	of the "name" first item from the list of text attributes.

	is always the icon name. Also got rid of copied and pasted code that's
	no longer needed for this case.
	(get_icon_additional_text_callback): Got rid of special case for name,

2000-04-19  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	Added a new, xml-based type of link file that can specify it's own
	icon and other behavior.  Soon they will be used for the novice

	adding the eazel-installer skelton.  very rough prototype right now
	but it works with my local configuration data.  Will be updated alot
	over the next few days.
	Location is components/services/install.  It is not part of the default
	build right now.

2000-04-18  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	made clicking on gmc-style URL files redirect to the specified URL.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c,h:
	added nautilus_file_get_mapped_uri, which checks for gmc-style URL files
	and returns the URL they reference in that case; otherwise, just return
	the file's URI.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	called nautilus_file_get_mapped_uri in fm_directory_view_activate_file_internal
	* data/mime/nautilus.keys:
	added icons to a few MIME types that I forgot last time.  Also, just
	use relative paths to reference the icons.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-text-item.c
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-text-item.h: New files.
	This is an editable icon text item used in the renaming feature.
	It is based on GnomeIconTextItem but modified to fix bugs in the
	original code and add extended functionality need by nautilus. If
	thse changes were rolled into the current GnomeIconTextItem, it
	would break gmc.

	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am
	Modified file so that the two new files listed above would properly
	be included in generated makefiles.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.c
	Split text class variable into two variables, editable_text and
	additonal_text. editable_text refers to attributes that the user
	can change via rename in place. additional_text is any other text
	that the user cannot edit via the rename in place feature. Added
	a boolean flag, is_renaming, to check against during various
	operations that effect the renaming feature. Removed ARG_TEXT
	argument ID and replaced with ARG_EDITABLE_TEXT and
	ARG_ADDITIONAL_TEXT.

	(draw_or_measure_label_text): Function now combines editable and
	additional text when performing the measuring operation.
	(compute_editable_text_rectangle): Added function to compute
	bounds of editable text. This is used to determine size and
	placement of editable text item when in renaming mode.
	(nautilus_icon_canvas_get_text_bounds): Public API to get bounds
	of icon label text.
	(nautilus_icon_canvas_get_editable_text_bounds): Public API to get

	editable text string.
	(nautilus_icon_canvas_item_set_renaming): Public API to toggle
	is_renaming flag.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-canvas-item.h
	Added public API prototypes to functions described above.	

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c

	accept modification. GDK_Escape ends rename mode and reverts
	modification to original.
	(nautilus_icon_container_initialize_class): icon_text_changed,
	get_icon_editable_text and get_icon_additional_text signals are
	registered.
	(editing_started): New function. Called when an edit begins.
	Inits class member variables for edit mode.
	(editing_stopped): New function. Called when edit ends. Cleans
	up edit mode.
	(nautilus_icon_container_initialize): rename_widget and original_text private variables
	are set to NULL.
	(icon_toggle_selected): Added call to end_renaming_mode.
	(nautilus_icon_container_update_icon): Added emitting of
	GET_ICON_EDITABLE_TEXT and GET_ICON_ADDITIONAL_TEXT
	signals. Updated gnome_canvas_item_set to use new arguments
	defined in nautilus-icon-text-item.
	(nautilus_icon_container_show_rename_widget): New
	function. Creates and displays renaming_widget.  Creates cached
	copy of original editable text for later compare, connects signals
	and enters renaming mode.
	(end_renaming_mode): New function. Cleans up and end renaming
	mode.
	(hide_rename_widget): Called by end_renaming_mode to hide and free

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-private.h
	Added boolean for renaming. Added a NautilusIconTextItem variable
	for the renaiming widget.

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c

	editable text for a later compare.  Removed get_icon_text_callback
	and added get_icon_editable_text_callback and
	get_icon_additonal_text_callback. These return the editable and
	additonal text of the icon view.
	(rename_icon_callback): Added callback that attempts to rename the
	NautilusFile the icon view represents. Action in not taken if
	there has been no change to the editable text. If the operation
	fails, the user is notified.

	attempt to change the filename to the new text. Notify user if
	operation fails.
	(get_icon_editable_text_callback): This callback returns the text
	items that are editable by the user using the "Rename" command. In
	the case of FMIconView, this would be the attribute with the name
	"name".
	(get_icon_additional_text_callback): This callback returns the
	text items that are not editable by the user using the "Rename"
	command.

2000-04-17  John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_monitor_add), (nautilus_file_monitor_remove):
	Added empty implementations for these two routines. Will
	fill in with actual code later after talking to Darin.

	* src/nautilus-index-title.c:
	(nautilus_index_title_set_uri): Monitor file for changes
	in directory item count.
	(release_file): Remove monitoring of file.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(name_field_done_editing), (name_field_focus_out),
	(name_field_focus_in), (create_properties_window):
	Made focusing away from the name field in the Properties
	window deselect the text, and focusing in select it.

2000-04-17  John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bugs, mostly related to editable text fields.

	* README: Made the contents of this file slightly helpful.
	
	* data/mime/nautilus.keys: Added an obscure MIME type that
	someone reported running into.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.h,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.c: New files. Define a
	subclass of GtkEntry (one-line text editing field) that fixes
	bugs and adds convenience functions.
	(nautilus_entry_key_press): Override key_press handler to treat
	the keypad Enter key the same as the other Enter key (in GtkEntry
	it inserts a "/r" into the text).
	(nautilus_entry_select_all): Select all text, and move the text
	cursor position to the end.
	(nautilus_entry_select_all_at_idle): Same, but do it at the next
	idle opportunity. Useful since nautilus_entry_select_all won't
	work right if called in a key_press signal handler.
	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am: Build these two new files.

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(name_field_activate): New function, updates file name and
	selects all text.
	(create_properties_window): Make name_field be a NautilusEntry.
	This fixes half of bug 433 (Enter keys don't work properly in
	properties window). Also attach to "activate" signal and update
	name change then. This fixes other half of bug 433. Also start
	with name field selected & focused. This fixes bug 432 (properties
	window should appear with name text selected).
	(name_field_update_to_match_file): Only update the displayed text
	if the new name coming in is different. This was needed to make
	select-all-on-activate work.
	(name_field_done_editing): Don't accept empty string as name;
	silently revert back to original name.

	* src/nautilus-bookmarks-window.c:
	(create_bookmarks_window): Change name & uri text fields to 
	NautilusEntry; this causes keypad Enter key to behave like other 
	Enter key. Also connect to focus_in and activate signals.
	(update_bookmark_from_text): New function, extracted from
	on_text_field_focus_out_event.
	(on_text_field_focus_out_event): Deselect all text after updating
	bookmark.
	(on_text_field_focus_in_event): New function, select all text.
	(name_or_uri_field_activate): New function, update bookmark and
	select all text.
	
	* src/nautilus-location-bar.c:
	(nautilus_location_bar_initialize): Use NautilusEntry instead of
	GtkEntry. This makes keypad Enter act like other Enter in uri-entry
	field.
	
	* src/ntl-window-msgs.c:
	(nautilus_window_end_location_change_callback): Make "Nautilus can't 
	handle this type of file" message mention (human-readable version of) 
	file type.

2000-04-17  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug involving making thumbnails for directories where we don't
	have write permissions by making them in $HOME/.nautilus/thumbnails.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-directory.c:
	moved escape_slashes routine to nautilus-strings so it can be shared
	* libnautilus/nautilus-string.c,h:
	added nautilus_str_escape_slashes, copies from nautilus-directory
	* libnautilus/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	added boolean to make_thumbnail_path to make the thumbnails in
	$HOME/.nautilus/thumbnails instead of in the local directory, and
	then used it when we can't write to the local one.
	
2000-04-16  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-index-panel.c:
	fixed problem where the command buttons in the index panel were overlapping
	the metaview.  They are not supposed to be showing if a metaview is selected.
	Fixed by hiding them in nautilus_index_panel_update_buttons if a metaview
	is selected.
	
2000-04-15  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	installed some icons for common file types, purloined from gmc
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	added a bunch of icons

	added icon-filename entries to appropriate mime-types
	
2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.h:
	After a chat with Rebecca, named nautilus_str_underscore_escape to
	nautilus_str_double_underscores since the latter name more
	accurately describes what it does.
	(nautilus_str_double_underscores): Changed the function to allow
	NULL and return NULL instead of doing g_return_val_if_fail.
	(Also reformatted a bit and made a few gratuitous changes.)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.h:
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_menu_display_name):
	Moved the logic about escaping menu characters up one level so
	the bookmark class doesn't have to know about it. This removes
	the function from NautilusBookmark completely.

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(append_bookmark_to_menu): Fixed a storage leak and moved the
	double-underscore escaping in here.

2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>

	Fixed test cases on nautilus-string.c to be correct

	Calls function to escape bookmark names

2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Finished task 174 (Use deferred calculation to compute directory
	counts).

	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-attributes.h: 
	Added a header file for names of file attributes.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h: 
	Added background computation of the "directory item count"
	attribute. This is serving as a test case for the API for
	requesting additional information.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(display_selection_info): Changed to use the new interface that
	can sometimes return "I don't know" for the number of items in
	a particular directory.
	(stop_load), (done_loading), (display_pending_files),
	(fm_directory_view_stop): Fixed a mistake in the old code where
	we stopped monitoring once the files were discovered. We need to
	keep monitoring.
	(finish_loading_uri): Pass in an attribute that we want to monitor:
	NAUTILUS_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY_ITEM_COUNT.

2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>
	
        Bookmarks with '_' characters display
	correctly now on menus

	New function to take bookmarks and return
	'_' escaped names
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c
	Calls function to escape bookmark names

Fri Apr 14 16:35:32 2000  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-rsvg.c: Added a command line tester for rsvg, which
	outputs alpha-transparent PNG's from SVG input files. The PNG save
	code is lifted from similar code in nautilus-icon-factory, and
	should be deleted when this functionality appears in gdk-pixbuf.

	* librsvg/Makefile.am: Build test-rsvg.

2000-04-14  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	using Raph's new machinery, made icons for .svg files use 
	a rendering of the file itself.
	
2000-04-14  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c (nautilus_window_constructed): Change the
	packing of the first pane so that it doesn't autoresize.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.c
	(nautilus_user_top_directory): Change this routine to use
	gnome_datadir_file to get the share directory.  Also, change to

	* libnautilus-extensions/.cvsignore: Fixed to match new directory
	contents.

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Split libnautilus into two pieces.  

	libnautilus now only contains the view interfaces needed by nautilus 
	components.

	These are the interfaces defined in nautilus-view-component.idl.
	
	libnautilus-extensions containes the remainder of the stuff.

	Also used the cvs repository munging opportunity to do some of the
	ntl-* renaming outlined in the RENAIMING file.

	* configure.in : Added tr to ALL_LINGUAS .

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* po/ChangeLog: Added this thing to make 'make dist' happy.

	Use that from now on for changes in po/.  Seems to be the standard
	thing to do.
	
2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus/libnautilus.h
	  libnautilus/nautilus-zoomable.h
	  libnautilus/ntl-view-frame.h:

	Include the new <nautilus-view-component.h> instead of
	<nautilus.h>
	
	  src/ntl-uri-map.h
	  src/ntl-view.h:

	Same.

	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:

	Did not build on redhat 5.2 because RPMTAG_FILENAMES has been
	obseleted in the version of rpm that ships with 5.2 apparently.
	I added a dumb hack to define RPMTAG_FILENAMES to
	RPMTAG_OLDFILENAMES which is almost surely the wrong thing to do,
	but i really need to have nautilus building while i do the
	nautilus view changes.  I gave myself a bug to properly address
	this soon (472).
