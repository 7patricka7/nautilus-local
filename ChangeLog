2000-04-18  John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_monitor_add), (nautilus_file_monitor_remove):
	Added empty implementations for these two routines. Will
	fill in with actual code later after talking to Darin.

	* src/nautilus-index-title.c:
	(nautilus_index_title_set_uri): Monitor file for changes
	in directory item count.
	(release_file): Remove monitoring of file.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(name_field_done_editing), (name_field_focus_out),
	(name_field_focus_in), (create_properties_window):
	Made focusing away from the name field in the Properties
	window deselect the text, and focusing in select it.

2000-04-18  John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bugs, mostly related to editable text fields.

	* README: Made the contents of this file slightly helpful.
	
	* data/mime/nautilus.keys: Added an obscure MIME type that
	someone reported running into.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.h,
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.c: New files. Define a
	subclass of GtkEntry (one-line text editing field) that fixes
	bugs and adds convenience functions.
	(nautilus_entry_key_press): Override key_press handler to treat
	the keypad Enter key the same as the other Enter key (in GtkEntry
	it inserts a "/r" into the text).
	(nautilus_entry_select_all): Select all text, and move the text
	cursor position to the end.
	(nautilus_entry_select_all_at_idle): Same, but do it at the next
	idle opportunity. Useful since nautilus_entry_select_all won't
	work right if called in a key_press signal handler.
	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am: Build these two new files.

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(name_field_activate): New function, updates file name and
	selects all text.
	(create_properties_window): Make name_field be a NautilusEntry.
	This fixes half of bug 433 (Enter keys don't work properly in
	properties window). Also attach to "activate" signal and update
	name change then. This fixes other half of bug 433. Also start
	with name field selected & focused. This fixes bug 432 (properties
	window should appear with name text selected).
	(name_field_update_to_match_file): Only update the displayed text
	if the new name coming in is different. This was needed to make
	select-all-on-activate work.
	(name_field_done_editing): Don't accept empty string as name;
	silently revert back to original name.

	* src/nautilus-bookmarks-window.c:
	(create_bookmarks_window): Change name & uri text fields to 
	NautilusEntry; this causes keypad Enter key to behave like other 
	Enter key. Also connect to focus_in and activate signals.
	(update_bookmark_from_text): New function, extracted from
	on_text_field_focus_out_event.
	(on_text_field_focus_out_event): Deselect all text after updating
	bookmark.
	(on_text_field_focus_in_event): New function, select all text.
	(name_or_uri_field_activate): New function, update bookmark and
	select all text.
	
	* src/nautilus-location-bar.c:
	(nautilus_location_bar_initialize): Use NautilusEntry instead of
	GtkEntry. This makes keypad Enter act like other Enter in uri-entry
	field.
	
	* src/ntl-window-msgs.c:
	(nautilus_window_end_location_change_callback): Make "Nautilus can't 
	handle this type of file" message mention (human-readable version of) 
	file type.

2000-04-17  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug involving making thumbnails for directories where we don't
	have write permissions by making them in $HOME/.nautilus/thumbnails.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-directory.c:
	moved escape_slashes routine to nautilus-strings so it can be shared
	* libnautilus/nautilus-string.c,h:
	added nautilus_str_escape_slashes, copies from nautilus-directory
	* libnautilus/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	added boolean to make_thumbnail_path to make the thumbnails in
	$HOME/.nautilus/thumbnails instead of in the local directory, and
	then used it when we can't write to the local one.
	
2000-04-16  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/ntl-index-panel.c:
	fixed problem where the command buttons in the index panel were overlapping
	the metaview.  They are not supposed to be showing if a metaview is selected.
	Fixed by hiding them in nautilus_index_panel_update_buttons if a metaview
	is selected.
	
2000-04-15  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	installed some icons for common file types, purloined from gmc
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	added a bunch of icons
	* icons/gnome-icon-x-mp3.png: new icon for mp3s
	* icons/gnome-compressed.png: new icon for gzips
	* icons/gnome-library.png: new icon for shared libraries
	* icons/gnome-manpage.png: new icon for man pages
	* icons/gnome-objectfile.png: new icon for object code files
	* icons/gnome-pack-deb.png: new icon for debian packages
	* icons/gnome-pack-rpm.png: new icon for rpm packages
	* icons/gnome-package: new icon for tar archives
	* data/mime/nautilus.keys:
	added icon-filename entries to appropriate mime-types
		
2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.h:
	After a chat with Rebecca, named nautilus_str_underscore_escape to
	nautilus_str_double_underscores since the latter name more
	accurately describes what it does.
	(nautilus_str_double_underscores): Changed the function to allow
	NULL and return NULL instead of doing g_return_val_if_fail.
	(Also reformatted a bit and made a few gratuitous changes.)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.h:
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_menu_display_name):
	Moved the logic about escaping menu characters up one level so
	the bookmark class doesn't have to know about it. This removes
	the function from NautilusBookmark completely.

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(append_bookmark_to_menu): Fixed a storage leak and moved the
	double-underscore escaping in here.

2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>

	Fixed test cases on nautilus-string.c to be correct
	
2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>

        Bookmarks with '_' characters display
	correctly now on menus
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c
	New function to escape '_' characters in strings
	for menu display
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c
	New function to take bookmarks and return
	'_' escaped names
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c
	Calls function to escape bookmark names

2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Finished task 174 (Use deferred calculation to compute directory
	counts).

	* libnautilus-extensions/Makefile.am: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-attributes.h: 
	Added a header file for names of file attributes.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: 
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h: 
	Added background computation of the "directory item count"
	attribute. This is serving as a test case for the API for
	requesting additional information.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(display_selection_info): Changed to use the new interface that
	can sometimes return "I don't know" for the number of items in
	a particular directory.
	(stop_load), (done_loading), (display_pending_files),
	(fm_directory_view_stop): Fixed a mistake in the old code where
	we stopped monitoring once the files were discovered. We need to
	keep monitoring.
	(finish_loading_uri): Pass in an attribute that we want to monitor:
	NAUTILUS_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY_ITEM_COUNT.

2000-04-14 Rebecca Schulman <rebecka@eazel.com>
	
        Bookmarks with '_' characters display
	correctly now on menus
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-string.c
	New function to escape '_' characters in strings
	for menu display
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c
	New function to take bookmarks and return
	'_' escaped names
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c
	Calls function to escape bookmark names

Fri Apr 14 16:35:32 2000  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-rsvg.c: Added a command line tester for rsvg, which
	outputs alpha-transparent PNG's from SVG input files. The PNG save
	code is lifted from similar code in nautilus-icon-factory, and
	should be deleted when this functionality appears in gdk-pixbuf.

	* librsvg/Makefile.am: Build test-rsvg.

2000-04-14  Andy Hertzfeld <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	using Raph's new machinery, made icons for .svg files use 
	a rendering of the file itself.
	
2000-04-14  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* src/ntl-window.c (nautilus_window_constructed): Change the
	packing of the first pane so that it doesn't autoresize.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.c
	(nautilus_user_top_directory): Change this routine to use
	gnome_datadir_file to get the share directory.  Also, change to
	using g_strdup_printf.

2000-04-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/.cvsignore: Fixed to match new directory
	contents.

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Split libnautilus into two pieces.  

	libnautilus now only contains the view interfaces needed by nautilus 
	components.

	These are the interfaces defined in nautilus-view-component.idl.
	
	libnautilus-extensions containes the remainder of the stuff.

	Also used the cvs repository munging opportunity to do some of the
	ntl-* renaming outlined in the RENAIMING file.

2000-04-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* configure.in : Added tr to ALL_LINGUAS .

2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* po/ChangeLog: Added this thing to make 'make dist' happy.

	Use that from now on for changes in po/.  Seems to be the standard
	thing to do.
	
2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus/libnautilus.h
	  libnautilus/nautilus-zoomable.h
	  libnautilus/ntl-view-frame.h:

	Include the new <nautilus-view-component.h> instead of
	<nautilus.h>
	
	  src/ntl-uri-map.h
	  src/ntl-view.h:

	Same.
	
2000-04-14  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/nautilus-rpm-view.c:

	Did not build on redhat 5.2 because RPMTAG_FILENAMES has been
	obseleted in the version of rpm that ships with 5.2 apparently.
	I added a dumb hack to define RPMTAG_FILENAMES to
	RPMTAG_OLDFILENAMES which is almost surely the wrong thing to do,
	but i really need to have nautilus building while i do the
	nautilus view changes.  I gave myself a bug to properly address
	this soon (472).
	
2000-04-14  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* ChangeLog-20000414: rolled over from ChangeLog.
